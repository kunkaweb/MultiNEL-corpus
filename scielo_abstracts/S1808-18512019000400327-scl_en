ABSTRACT  Introduction: The main causative agent of spinal infections is Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, followed by saprophytes of the skin. The most affected segment is the lumbar, followed by the thoracic.  Objective: Case report.  Results: A previously healthy 40-year-old man with posterior cervical pain and myelopathy was referred to our spine service for vertebral destruction syndrome in C3-C4 and altered carbohydrate metabolism. Microdiscectomy and abscess drainage were performed and a biopsy was taken for definitive diagnosis. Multiresistant Serratia Marcescens was isolated in the culture. Both the myelopathy and carbohydrate intolerance were resolved as the infection was resolved.  Conclusion: The significance of this case lies in the infective presentation of the S. Marcescens in an immunocompetent person, since it is mainly an opportunistic microorganism, and in the atypical location. The most commonly isolated pathogen is Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, followed by Staphylococcus aureus. Identification of the causative agent is essential to the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Therefore, microbiological isolation plays a fundamental role in the treatment, recovery and quality of life of the patient. Level of evidence V; Case report.
