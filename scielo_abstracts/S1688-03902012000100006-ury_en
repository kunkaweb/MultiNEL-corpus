Summary The study presents the clinical case of a 66 year old patient carrier of a spongiform encephalopathy with diagnostic criteria matching a probable sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These variegated clinical manifestations, together with the low incidence of the disease led us to initially consider several differential diagnoses. Yet, the arousal of dementia and myoclonus and triphasic periodic complexes evidenced in the electroencephalogram and the presence of 14-3-3 protein in the Cephalorachidian fluid in the second sample collected contributed to the final diagnosis.
