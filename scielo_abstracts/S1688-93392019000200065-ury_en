Abstract: Pediatric dentists play a significant role in the early detection of oral pathologies at a young age because they are usually the first to have contact with the child. This enables them to detect mouth lesions, such as geographic tongue, which is a reddish lesion that appears and disappears and leads parents to seek professional help as they are alarmed. It is essential to reassure parents that it is a benign lesion, which generally does not require treatment 1. This article aims to present two clinical cases, with different signs and symptoms, for which it is important to know the specific clinical characteristics of the geographic tongue and clinical management.
