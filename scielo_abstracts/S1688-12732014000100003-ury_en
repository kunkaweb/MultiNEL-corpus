Pheochromocytoma is a tumor catecholamine-producing derived from chromaffin cells of the sympathetic nervous system that can cause severe hypertension among other systemic disorders. They may be sporadic or be associated with several genetic diseases: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, von Hippel-Lindau, neurofibromatosis type 1 and familial paraganglioma disease. When a patient who is suspected the presence of a pheochromocytoma presents with a surgical urgency represents a great challenge for the anesthesiologist, since in this situation the mortality increases significantly. We report the case of a patient who was found to be carrying a pheochromocytoma, integrating a MEN 2b syndrome with bilateral adrenal masses showed the urgency with bowel obstruction with severe hypertensive crisis with acute pulmonary edema.
