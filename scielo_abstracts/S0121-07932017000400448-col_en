SUMMARY Oncocytic papiloma (OP) is a rare neoplasm of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is the least common histological subtype of sinonasal papilloma. OP is regarded as a benign tumor like inverted papilloma (IP), but its biological behavior is not so benign due to its aggressive local growth, the high rate of recurrences and the risk of malignant transformation with associated carcinoma. Endoscopic resection is the treatment of choice for OP. No relevant reports on the use of radiotherapy are known in patients with OP with advanced disease or extrasinonasal extension without associated malignancy, although its application in advanced IP has been successfull. We report a case of unilateral left OP with advanced disease that involved lateral nasal wall, maxillary, ethmoidal and frontal sinus on the same side, treated with volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy.
