This is an assistance project for the implementation of a group focusing dietary reeducation and life quality within 'Programa de Saúde da Família de Porto Alegre', a family health program. The objective of this proposal was the introduction of group practices to both educate on and prevent health disorders associated with feeding through group dynamics. Group activities have been described in a field diary. This enabled the research team to contemplate not only the particular specifics of actions but also the reflective character triggered by the dynamics and reports collected. Therefore, assistance could be viewed under an educational focus, relying on elements such as the promotion of interpersonal relationships which converge to the establishment of trust and self-determination. In this way, there was an investment in the development of a favorable environment for the revision of behaviors and conditionings.
