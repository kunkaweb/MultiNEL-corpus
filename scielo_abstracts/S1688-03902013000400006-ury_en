Abstract Introduction: gliomatosis cerebri (GC) is a neoepithelium neoplastic disease affecting at least two lobes. Its clinical presentation is non-specific, imagenology and pathological anatomy studies being the main diagnostic pillars. The incidence of GC is low and average age of presentation is in the forties and fifties years of age. Method: The study presents two clinical cases; the first one of which manifests as depressed consciousness associated to alterations in behavior, the second one manifesting as unsteady gait. In both cases diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance and pathological anatomy. Results: both patients evidenced a two month survival rate subsequent to diagnosis, and no treatment was applied given the bad evolution of the disease. Conclusions: GC is a low incidence neoplastic disease with varied forms of clinical presentation. Its diagnosis is based on two main pillars: imagenology and pathological anatomy studies. Associating chemotherapy (temozolomide) to the classic treatment of radiotherapy seems to result in higher response rates, although its impact on survival is still poor. Prognosis is bad, and survival rates range from 6 to 12 months.
