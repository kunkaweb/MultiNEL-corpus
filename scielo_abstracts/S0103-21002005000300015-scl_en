The authors tried to present theoretical and practical framework of the project "Corporeal and Health", developed as an extension activity at the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo city, Brazil. The project is developed within the Health Promotion area and emphasizes the questions related to the body and sexuality, mental health, and violence, in order to catalyze discussions and critical thinking on this universe. The main purpose of this project is to articulate nursing teaching, caring and researching actions and its activities are directed to teenagers and young adults from fundamental and high school. All activities are based upon the orientations of the Adolescent Health Program (PROSAD) from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Brazilian Child and Adolescent Statute (ECA) and the Declaration of Sexual Rights, from the World Association for Sexology, along with principles from Social Psychology and Psycho Analysis. It is a liberating practice in which sexuality, when is well understood and properly canalized, can be translated into love, creativity, a force that lead to progress and self development.
