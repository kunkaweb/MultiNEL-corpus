Case report of a 79 year old male, with multiple soft tissue injuries in both lower limbs and with associated comorbidities like diabetes and heart disease that made difficult their management. We decided to put partial thickness skin grafts, and in the postoperative process we used VACÂ® therapy to accelerate the graft integration process, obtaining complete healing and coverage of the exposed areas. We made a review of the literature and we can corroborate that this new technique is effective in the management of diabetic and cardiovascular patients.
