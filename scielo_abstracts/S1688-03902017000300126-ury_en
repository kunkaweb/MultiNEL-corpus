Abstract: Propofol is a widely used anesthetic in the Intensive Care Unit. At times it may cause rather an unusual adverse reaction known as propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS), characterized by hemodynamic instability, rhabdomyolysis, lactic acidosis, and multiple-organ dysfunction. The study presents a case of PRIS with fatal outcome, including a discussion of its physiopathology, clinical aspects and considerations to be borne in mind when using propofol.
