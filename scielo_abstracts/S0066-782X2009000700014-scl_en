We report a case of dobutamine stress echocardiography-induced Takotsubo syndrome in a 76-year-old hypertensive patient with clinical complaints of chest pain in an elective visit to the cardiologist. Dobutamine-stress-echocardiography was requested to rule out chest pain of coronary origin. During the test, at peak exercise, echocardiogram showed apical akinesia and electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in D1, AVL, and V2. The patient was hospitalized and underwent coronary angiography, which showed normal coronary arteries and left ventricular apical ballooning. During follow-up, the patient's condition remained stable, with regression of the manifestations 21 days after the initial presentation.
