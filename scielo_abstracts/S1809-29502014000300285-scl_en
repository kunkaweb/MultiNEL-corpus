Stroke is the result of disorientation of brain activity of vascular origin, with more than 24 hours. The constrain induction movement therapy (CIMT) is a highlighting method for motor rehabilitation that provides cortical reorganization. The aim of this study was to evaluate the motor function after stroke in a child before and after CIMT. Participated in this study, a female child, nine years old and with chronic left hemiparesis. For the simultaneous analysis of the flexor and extensor muscles of the wrist in maximal voluntary isometric contraction, at the start and the end of CIMT protocol, we used surface electromyography and stabilometry to balance access. The patient had constricted close to the body the non-paretic upper limb, enabling only the use of the paretic upper limb. Still, 14 consecutive sessions of physiotherapy were performed. For constriction, we use a tubular mesh for 23 hours per day. The analysis revealed a root mean square (RMS) increase in flexors and extensors to the wrist, improves balance and weight bearing. Thus, fourteen days CIMT associated a functional activities protocol resulted in an improved of extensors and flexors of the wrist muscle activation pattern and a significant improvement of the balance of the patient.
