Enteropathic achrodermatitis is of a low incidence but of a great clinical relevance, which must be recognized quickly and accurately by dermatologists and pediatricians, so that the treatment can be given to control the quick progression of the lesions and the serious systemic changes that may associate with the cutaneous signs characteristic of this disease. Although it was initially described 70 years ago, it as not until 15 years ago that it was established that it was not of an infectious etiology but rather due to a zinc deficiency as a consequence of a genetic alteration of the transport mechanism of the ion. This is the case of a malnourished patient, short stature for his age, delayed psychomotor development and severe skin lesions, who was admitted to the Hospital Militar Central de Bogota after being treated in other institutions with multiple therapies which worsened his symptoms. From the start it was suspected that this was enteropathic achrodermatitis, confirmed by thorough testing, and there was complete resolution of the lesions 3 weeks after the treatment was initiated.
