Abstract: A case of spastic paraparesis associated with HTLV-I retrovirus was described in a 34-year-old patient whose diagnosis was made 17 years after the onset of his disease. It was obtained by determining antibodies in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. In the national literature there are only two previously published cases. The objective of the presentation of the case is to recall the main epidemiological, clinical and paraclinical characteristics of said pathology, as well as to re-establish the importance of considering the HTLV-Ia the etiological search time of a chronic myelopathy, and to maintain the blood controls of donors and blood products to eliminate one of the main routes of infection.
