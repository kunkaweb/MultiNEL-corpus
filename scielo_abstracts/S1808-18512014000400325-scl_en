The objective of this study is to highlight the possibility of dysphagia induced by    anterior cervical osteophytes. When not diagnosed early this condition may be    responsible for complications such as severe dysphagia and potential lung aspiration,    especially in elderly patients. Analysis of a case report of a 72-year old woman who    presented cervical pain and progressive dysphagia. Imaging studies have shown    anterior cervical osteophytosis and multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical    spine. The patient underwent surgical excision of the cervical anterior osteophytes     (C4, C5 and C6) and C5/C6 arthrodesis through anterior approach. The postoperative    period was uneventful and symptoms resolved within 2 weeks. Early diagnosis and    treatment led to complete resolution, avoiding late and serious complications    associated with this pathology in the geriatric population, especially severe and    progressive dysphagia and risk of pulmonary aspiration, and the consequent morbidity    and mortality associated. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for the correct    assessment of this condition
