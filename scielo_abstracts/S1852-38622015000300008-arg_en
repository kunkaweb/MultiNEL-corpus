The anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is a rare entity. We report a case of a 44 year old male patient was admitted for acute heart failure syndrome with echocardiographic finding of severe mitral regurgitation due to calcification of the posterior papillary muscle. During the hemodynamic study the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery found, filled by heterocoronary circulation. The coronary arteries showed no angiographically significant lesions. During evolution, a myocardial perfusion study showed severe apical ischemia, anteroapical and lateroapical was performed. The patient underwent surgery for mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass graft in the same surgical time, with good results.
