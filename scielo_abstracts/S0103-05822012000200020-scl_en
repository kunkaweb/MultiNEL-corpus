OBJECTIVE: To report two cases of patients with celiac disease (CD) whose main complaint was chronic constipation. CASE DESCRIPTION: Two girls, aged 18 and 30 months, had chronic constipation refractory to standard treatment. Both patients concomitantly evidenced low weight gain and short stature. The investigation of the digestive-absorptive function was positive for IgA antibodies against tissue transglutaminase. The diagnosis of CD was confirmed by a small bowel biopsy that showed moderate/severe villous atrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration. One month after starting the dietary treatment with a gluten-free diet, both patients recovered from constipation, with the passage of soft stools daily. COMMENTS: CD may be presented in the classical, asymptomatic or atypical forms. In the latter form, isolated manifestations, surch as constipation, delay the diagnosis of the disease.
