ABSTRACT  Objective: To report the use of virtual reality (VR) in pain intensity during dressing change of two burned children hospitalized in a Burn Treatment Center (BTC) in Southern Brazil.  Method: Case report on the use of VR during dressing change of two burned children hospitalized in a BTC, from May to July 2016. For assessing pain, a facial pain rating scale was applied at four times: just before the dressing, during the dressing without the use of VR, during the dressing with the VR, and after the use of VR.  Results: The use of goggles was easy to apply and well-accepted by the children, and also had a relevant effect reducing pain.  Conclusion: VR can become an important nonpharmacological method for treating pain in burned children.
