Carbon monoxide poisoning associated with transient deterioration of left ventricular systolic function Case report Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a common form of intoxication in the modern world. While the neurological effects of CO are well established, information on the cardiovascular features of this condition is limited to cases series or reports. We present the case of a young woman with no known risk factors or cardiovascular disease who presented with transient deterioration of left ventricular systolic function after severe CO intoxication. After receiving standard care for CO poisoning, the patient evolved favorably and was discharged without complications.
