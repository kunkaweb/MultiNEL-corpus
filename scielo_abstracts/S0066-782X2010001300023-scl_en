We report the case of a 66 year-old female patient with infectious endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis and adenocarcinoma of the colon that developed acute aortic insufficiency. She was submitted to aortic valve replacement surgery and later to tumor resection (right hemicolectomy). It is important to emphasize the need for complementing the study of the colon, even in asymptomatic individuals, when infectious endocarditis due to S. bovis is diagnosed.
