Summary: Nocardiosis is a rare infection. The two most prevalent species, N. asteroides and N. brasiliensis, can cause a broad spectrum of clinical diseases, which could be local or disseminated infections with an acute, subacute or chronic evolution. It can cause severe infections to immunocompromised patients, or even to healthy children, who can experience skin and soft tissue infections. This is the clinical case of a healthy 18-month-old girl with a foot abscess with right inguinal adenophlegmon. The microbiological study of the lesion drainage confirmed a diagnosis of Nocardia sp. She was treated with clotrimazole for 6 weeks and had no further complications. The initial immunoassay showed no abnormalities. The patientâ€™s evolutionary follow-up does not show alterations resulting from specific immunological disorders.
