SUMMARY Pediatric cardiac catheterization usually requires general anesthesia. The objetive of this study was to evaluate an anesthesia technique with propofol-ketamine, with spontaneous breathing. An infant of 19 months, ASA 3, 10 kg, with dylated myocardiopathy; waiting for a cardiac transplant was admitted to the catheterization laboratory. He was premedicated with ketamine i/m, and then started a infusion of propofol-ketamine, with a rate of 33.3 mcg/kg/min for propofol and 16.7 mcg/kg/min for ketamine. He needed a suplementary dosis of 0.5 mg/kg of propofol, and after then was registered a drop of saturation from 99% to 96%; which corrects with oxygen via a face mask. There were not any other incidents during all the procedure. Pulmonary pressure and transpulmonary gradient were normal. There were not any hemodynamics disturbances nor any complications, and 24 hours later was discharged home. We conclude that this was a safe kind of anesthesia for pediatric cardiac patient, with spontaneously breathing patient and hemodynamic stability.
