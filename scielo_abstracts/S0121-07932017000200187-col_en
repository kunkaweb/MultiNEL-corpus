SUMMARY Canalicular adenoma is an unusual benign epithelial neoplasm of the minor salivary glands located primarily on the upper lip. It appears as a slowgrowing node, less than 3 cm in diameter, painless, and non-ulcerated. Differential diagnosis should be made with other tumors of the salivary glands such as basal cell adenoma, pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. We report the case of a female with a history of canalicular adenoma (CA) on the upper lip, removed 13 years before, who consulted on June 2015 because of a mass, 8 mm in diameter with the same location as the previous lesion. On September 2015, the lesion and the accessory salivary gland were removed. Histopathological study found the same diagnosis as before (CA), and revealed multifocality of the neoplasm in the accessory salivary gland.
