Abstract: Orbitotemporal neurofibromatosis is a progressive disease that begins in childhood and may cause important morphological and functional alterations. We present the case of an adult patient with a giant orbitotemporal neurofibromatosis, which was treated by preoperative embolization and a surgical resection to reduce the size of the tumor size.
