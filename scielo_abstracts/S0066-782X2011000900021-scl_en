Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare disease that is likely to develop in the embryonic period. It is caused by the intrauterine arrest of the myocardial compaction process in the beginning of the fetal development. It is characterized by prominent myocardial trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses, as well as the thickening of the myocardium into two distinct layers (compacted and not compacted). Even though this disease is said to be prevalent in the pediatric population or together with congenital heart disease, one can understand that this disease occurs in isolation, because the diagnosis is becoming more common in adult patients that have no other heart disease. The clinical manifestations vary greatly, because they range from absence of symptoms to congestive heart failure, arrhythmias and systemic thromboembolism. Echocardiography is the most widely used diagnostic procedure, but the little knowledge about this disease, its similarity to other myocardial diseases and the limitation of the echocardiographic technique used delay the diagnosis. The purpose of this review is to show that that other imaging techniques, such as MRI, CT and left ventriculography have emerged as diagnostic alternatives.
