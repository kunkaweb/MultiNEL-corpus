Abstract: The Li-Fraumeni syndrome (SLF) is a highly penetrant condition with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, characterized by an early onset of multiple tumors in a subject and a marked familial occurrence. About 70 % of patients meeting clinical criteria for diagnosis of the disease carry the germline mutation of TP53 gene located in chromosome 17p13. TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene known for its major role in genome stability control. It has been estimated that risk of cancer development is 50 % for women at the age of 31 and for men at the age of 46 and nearly 100 % for both men and women at 70 years of age. Except at earlier ages of diagnosis, the clinical course of the disease for healthy patients and for patients suffering SLF shows similarities. We present the case of a 31-year-old patient diagnosed both with pelvic chondrosarcoma treated surgically and localized breast cancer during relapse, about 8 months later. By Sanger sequencing, mutation 375G>C had been identified in TP53 gene in another family member, and said mutation was later detected in our patient. We discuss particular aspects of treatment procedures, such as minimizing radiotherapy exposure (due to reports of malignancies in radiated areas) and the special management of diagnosis implications for other family members.
