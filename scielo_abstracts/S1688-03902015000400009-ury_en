Abstract Spinal epidural empyema is a suppurating infection of the central nervous system, more frequent in male patients and during the midlife stage. Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly found microorganism. It reaches the epidural space extending contiguously, by direct inoculation or distant spread. It manifests with fever, spinal pain and neurological deficit. Three cases of spinal epidural empyema are presented and clinical, microbiological and therapeutic considerations are made.
