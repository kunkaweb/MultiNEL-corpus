BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Deficiency in protein S, which is a glycoprotein with anticoagulant activity, increases the risk for thromboembolic events. This report aimed at addressing anesthetic management of protein S deficient obstetric patient. CASE REPORT: Protein S deficient patient, at 25 weeks gestation, presented the following lab results: INR = 0.9, TTPA = 32 s (control 25.6), protein S = 35% (normal = 70% to 130%). In the last three gestation quarters she has received up to 12,000 IU heparin every 8 hours. With 38 weeks, she was admitted in labor. After 8 uninterrupted heparin hours, already with TTPA of 25.8 s (control 27.8 s) epidural anesthesia was induced with 6 ml of 0.2% bupivacaine and fentanyl (20 Âµg), followed by continuous infusion. Infusion time was 5 hours with total 40 mg bupivacaine dose. There have been no intercurrences and 1 hour after catheter removal, subcutaneous 10,000 IU heparin were restarted at 12-hour intervals. Patient and neonate evolved well and were discharged 3 days later. CONCLUSIONS: Protein S deficient pregnant patients should receive anticoagulants to maintain TTPA twice the control value. Heparin, for not crossing placental barrier, is the anticoagulant of choice in obstetrics. Blockade may be induced respecting a minimum period of 4 to 6 hours between last heparin dose and lumbar puncture, provided lab tests are within normal ranges. In these cases, however, epidural analgesia may help in preventing thromboembolic events.
