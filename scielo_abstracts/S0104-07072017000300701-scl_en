ABSTRACT  Objective: reporting the construction and application of a consent form for hospitalized children.   Method: a qualitative experience report study. Consent form construction was based on the guidelines of the World Health Organization and Resolution 466/2012. It was applied to 42 children between seven and ten years old, hospitalized in clinical-surgical units of a pediatric hospital.   Results: a consent form in the form of an illustrated booklet was constructed to meet the national ethical regulation of research with children. Its application revealed that the format used contributed to children's understanding of the objectives of the study, allowing their consent and their collaboration in data collection. We also reaffirm the relevance of play (ludic) as a strategy for understanding among a children's audience.   Conclusion: developing and applying the consent form as an illustrated booklet was a successful experiment for research with children, proving to be effective in clarifying their doubts regarding obtaining consent.
