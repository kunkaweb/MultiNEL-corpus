Amitraz poisoning typically produces a variety of symptoms, among others bradycardia and hypotension with hemodynamic collapse, that can be life-threatening; it can also show neurological and respiratory depression, all these explained by a fall in the sympathetic tone at central and peripheral level. Defects in heart rate are not the most outstanding characteristic of this sort of intoxication, since no direct cardio toxic effects have been proven to be caused by this chemical. This article reports a case where cardiac conduction defect is observed after ingestion of amitraz. Cardiovascular toxicity was manifested as hypotension, bradycardia, and also included was a second degree atrioventricular Mobitz I block, which spontaneously reverted after a 24 hour monitoring.
