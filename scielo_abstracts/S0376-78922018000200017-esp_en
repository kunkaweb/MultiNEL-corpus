Oroantral fistula is a pathological communication between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus. There are several causes, being the maxillary and jaw osteonecrosis by intravenous bisphosponates an important cause which was reportedby the first time in 2003. The bisphosphonates have been used with good results in treatment of several cancers and in bone metastases, especially in breast cancer, where the survival rate has increased in the recent years. We report a representative case of a 58-year-old female with previous history of breast cancer and bone metastases. She had been trea-ted with chemotherapy and intravenous bisphosphonates and had developed maxillary and jaw osteonecrosis. After that, she underwent surgery with extraction of first molar and acquired an oroantral fistula. The present case reminds us of an important risk factor for oroantral fistula in patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates. Thus, due to the increasing survival rate in breast cancer patients, the oroantral fistula prevalence is going to increase exponentially.
