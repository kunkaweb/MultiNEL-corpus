The ganglioneuroma is a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system and may be associated with hypersecretion of vasoactive substances responsible for various symptoms and signs such as hypertension. The authors report a case of ganglioneuroma and a literature review, focusing on the most important aspects of diagnosis and therapy. The patient had recurrent symptomatic hypertensive crises, having performed an imaging study that found a nodule in the right adrenal gland. As neuroblastic tumors are radiologically undistinguishable, the patient underwent excision, confirming the diagnosis by pathology analysis. This case demonstrates the clinical variability of ganglioneuroma, the usefulness of imaging and the importance of histological study.
