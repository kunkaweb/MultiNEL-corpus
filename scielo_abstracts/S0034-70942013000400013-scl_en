Endotracheal intubation is performed to establish a secure airway. However, this carries its risks and obstruction of an endotracheal tube (ETT) is a potentially life-threatening event. We report two cases with an obstruction of the resterilized, single use, spiral, reinforced endotracheal tubes by dissection of the internal wall. As a conclusion, we suggest not reusing and resterilizing single tubes in these cases to avoid a complication like dissection of the internal wall of the tube, as this has been the main cause.
