Abstract: Short bowel syndrome consists of intestinal failure after a massive intestinal resection. It is an unusual condition, ranging from a mild and reversible malfunction to a severe condition causing inability. Short bowel syndrome has high morbimortality, high medical costs and a significant impact on quality of life. 50% of patients with short bowel syndrome do not spontaneously adapt and neither does absorption improve by the remaining intestine, thus they depend on parenteral nutrition for the rest of their lives. Specialized nutritional therapy and focalized hormone therapy in the intestine are pillars in rehabilitation. They promote intestine adaptation and achieve independence from parenteral nutrition and avoid intestinal transplant. Today, Teduglutide is the reference treatment for these patients, although it is still not available in Uruguay due to its high cost. The study presents a 23 year old patient carrier of chronic intestinal failure due to short bowel syndrome who has depended on parenteral nutrition for 17 years and presents severe complications associated to this technique.
