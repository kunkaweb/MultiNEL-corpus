Summary Vasa previa (VP) is an unusual cause of metrorrhagia in the third trimester of pregnancy, where the blood vessels coming from the placenta are located in front of the internal cervical os. In the vast majority of cases this pathology is not diagnosed during pregnancy unless it is specifically looked for, and it results in high mortality rates ranging from 60% to 90% according to different sources. A clinical case is presented: A 26 year old patient, 1.41m high, nulliparous, is admitted to hospital to undergo a coordinated c-section due to cephalopelvic disproportion absolute narrow pelvis. A live male newborn is obtained, Apgar 9 after one minute and 10 after five minutes. During delivery it was found that placenta was fundal and normally located although there was vasa previa. We emphasize on the importance of prenatal diagnosis with Doppler scanning to draw up a timely and planned treatment and thus significantly diminish mortality resulting from this infrequent, though lethal condition.
