ABSTRACT   Objective Neurenteric cysts account for 0.7â€“1.3% of all spinal cord tumors. These rare lesions are composed of heterotopic endodermal tissue.   Methods A 26-year-old woman with a 13-month history of severe cervicalgia and brachial paresthesia. Clinically she had mildbilateral brachial paresis (4/5), generalized hyperreflexia and a left Babinski Sign. Past medical history was significant for a cervical fistula closure when she was 1yearold. The superior somatosensory evoked potentials revealed medullary axonal damage with a left predominance. A cervical magnetic resonance imaging of the neck was performed showing a dorsal homogeneous cystic intradural extramedullary lesion with high signal intensity on T2. Computed tomography revealed a Klippel-Feil syndrome.   Results A posterior laminectomy and surgical excision were performed without complications. Post-operative follow-up showed a complete recovery of arm strength. The histopathological report confirmed the preoperative diagnosis of neurenteric cyst. Most neurenteric cysts are located in the spine, mainly in a ventral position. A total of 95% of neurenteric cysts are found in the intradural/intramedullary compartment. Symptomatic neurenteric cysts typically appear in the second and third decades of life and are 1.5 to 3 times more common in men. In 50% of the cases, other vertebral malformations have also been reported. In this case, a congenital dorsal enteric cyst and a Klippel-Feil syndrome were observed.   Conclusions The intraspinal neurenteric cysts are rare lesions that must be included in the differential diagnosis of a dorsal, intradural cystic structure. The diagnosis may be overlooked, especially in cases of chronic neck pain without neurological deficit. Level of evidence V; Expert Opinion.
