Summary: Coronary artery anomalies are a clinical condition of very low incidence. Out of these, the anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the trunk of the pulmonary artery (ARCAPA) is estimated to represent 0.002% of the general population. It may be associated with the presence of other congenital cardiac anomalies. The study presents the case of a 33 week preterm newborn twin who is diagnosed with an anomalous origin of the right coronary in a routine echocardiographic study performed in the Intensive Care Unit. The diagnosis is confirmed by cardiac catheterization and definitive surgical correction is performed at 6 months of age, the child being currently asymptomatic and enjoying a normal quality of life. We stand out the low frequency of the occurrence of this pathology. We performed a review of the main topics in the development of the coronary vascular tree and their main anomalies. We emphasize on the importance of performing an adequate Echocardiographic study as an assessment of patients admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units.
