Abstract Perianal tuberculosis is rather a unusual a presentation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 0.7% of all localizations. Given its low prevalence, diagnosis is seldom made, being it defined by means of a biopsy and the pathological anatomy confirmation. This allows for the specific anti-tuberculosis treatments, achieving excellent results and curing the disease. The study presents the clinical case of a patient carrier of perianal tuberculosis concomitant with a bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis with no cavitation -no respiratory symptoms-, that appears as a perianal ulcerous lesion. Diagnosis was made with a biopsy and the histological study of the sample. Treatment was based on the Honorary Tuberculosis Committee, and the patient was cured after six months of treatment.
