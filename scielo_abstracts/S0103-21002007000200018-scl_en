To describe strategies that might promote technical and cultural and common knowledge dialogue between nurses and mothers during the mother-child binomial nursing consultation. A purposive sample of 30 women who had regular nursing consultation appointment was used. Data were collected throughout a period of 6 months and consisted of taking notes of verbal discussions with women regarding their experiences with mother-child binomial nursing care. Data were recorded using field diary. The model of nursing care was modified during data collection to attend the mother-child binominal needs. Strategies to modify the model of nursing care to enhance dialogue between nurses and the mother-child binomial might be essential to improve efficacy and humanization of nursing care.
