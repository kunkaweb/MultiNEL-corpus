This is an experience report that has the goal of presenting reflections on the experiences lived with undergraduate Nursing students of the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro. In the day-to-day teaching practice students have to deal with adolescents that are victims of onco-hematogenic disorders. It was observed that for the students it was a challenge to learn how to care for adolescents suffering from cancer, an illness that brings with it important significances in the social imaginary. As a learning strategy was used an activity called workshop of ideas, which made possible for the students to express their feelings, their (pre)conceived ideas and their expectations regarding the care for adolescents with cancer. Results evidenced a unique moment of reflection/sensibilization that leads to a preparation and to recognition of the peculiarities of this group of patients, and to an attitude that brings them closer to caring within the hospital space.
