This study reports the case of an anomalous implantation of VVI pacemaker electrode in the left ventricle (LV) diagnosed during routine evaluation, two years after implantation. The patient is a 65-year-old woman with Chagas disease. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a pattern of right branch block. Profile chest X-ray showed electrode with posterior curvature path. In transthoracic echocardiography, the diagnosis revealed that the catheter penetrated the right atrium, crossed the atrial septum, descended through the left atrium and mitral valve orifice and deployed on the LV wall. The following related aspects are addressed: potential deployment routes, clinical, radiological, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic pictures, complications and treatment options.
