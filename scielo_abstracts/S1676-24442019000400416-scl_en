ABSTRACT Evans syndrome (ES) is a rare autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. ES occurs when there is a combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) with thrombocytopenia, whether or not accompanied by immune neutropenia. This syndrome fits into a special variable type of warm AHAI and may be related to rheumatic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Its pathogenesis is still far away to be fully understood. Direct Coombs test results are positive in 98% of cases. ES treatment is required when the anemia due to hemolysis is intense, and corticotherapy is recommended initially. In refractory cases, splenectomy or rituximab therapy, as well as other immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine, may be used. In this study, we present the case of a 45-year-old patient, male, who was diagnosed with ES associated with active SLE. The patient was admitted to the emergency room presenting severe hemolytic anemia and onset of thrombocytopenia. He was treated with intravenous corticosteroid therapy, followed by azathioprine.
