Abstract Even with all the preventive measures used in pediatric dentistry, early childhood caries is a problem faced daily in pediatric dentistry, and mainly affects the vestibular surface of the anterior teeth in children younger than 71 months. The present study reports a case of aesthetic-functional rehabilitation per formed with the help of laboratory-made strip crows and composite in a 5-year-old patient affected by multiple lesions of early childhood caries. Composite resin restorations were performed on all upper anterior teeth to restore aesthetics and function, offering a better quality of life for the child and her family. The preparation of composite resin crowns with the help of strip crowns resulted in a shorter clinical time, a better aesthetic result and the restoration of the patientâ€™s smile and self-esteem.
