Summary: Congenital hyperinsulinism (CH) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in newborns and children at a high risk of irreversible neurological damage. In spite of the recent progress made by the molecular geneticsâ€™ genetic base, diagnosis is still often late, given the heterogeneity of this disease. We hereby report the case of a patient ranging from secondary and difficult to control hypoglycemia to congenital hyperinsulinemia. Her genetic test showed ABCC8 gene mutation.
