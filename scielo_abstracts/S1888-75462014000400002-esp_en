Objective: The present case study analyzes semen quality, nutritional patterns, and hormonal and oxidative status of an international high-level triathlete with a low-volume, high-intensity training load. Method: The athlete was 26 years old, having participated in competitions since he was 13 years old, and practiced professional triathlon for the last five years. The qualitative sperm parameters analyzed were volume, sperm count, motility, morphology, and DNA fragmentation (additional testing performed as needed). Salivary hormones measured were T, C, and T/C. Seminal plasma total antioxidant capacity was measured. Maximum oxygen consumption and training characteristics were assessed. To determine habitual food intake and its possible repercussion on oxidative status, a quali-quantitative frequency questionnaire of 136 different foods was used and subsequently analyzed using specific software. Results: Hormonal and physical semen parameters were within normal ranges. Sperm morphology and DNA fragmentation showed abnormal values (3.9% and 38.33%). Round cells in semen were higher than normal (2.3 million/ml), with presence of macrophages. Apoptotic and necrotic events were observed. Total antioxidant capacity, although not compromised, was low. Dietetic intake was characterized by excess protein and appropriate overall antioxidant intake (with slight deficit and excess of some specific nutrients) according to recommended values. Conclusions: In this high-intensity endurance athlete, sperm parameters, mainly sperm morphology and DNA fragmentation, are altered. Further knowledge is needed with regards nutritional antioxidant intake and other dietetic strategies oriented toward avoiding oxidative damage in semen of high-performance triathletes. Moreover, adequate nutritional strategies must be found and nutritional advice given to athletes so as to palliate or dampen the effects of exercise on semen quality.
