Autism is one of the most common neurological disorders that affects the neurological development of children. Therapeutic interventions may intervene in communication disorders and stereotyped behaviors such as dancing, which as therapy can activate sensory pathways that enable gesture improvement. This study aimed to observe the effects of dance therapy in motor performance and gesture, body balance and gait, as well as in the quality of life of an adolescent with autistic disorder. It is a case study of a fifteen-year-old male who participated in 120 sessions of dance therapy, lasting 30 minutes, twice a week, on alternate days, over a period of one year. The assessment instruments used were the Motor Function Measure (MFM), Tinetti test and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). According to the MFM, the total score increased 27.08%; the Tinetti test regarding balance increased from 68 to 75%, and gait, from 16% to 66%. CARS changed from 41.5 to 34 points, changing the severe disorder to moderate within the proposed parameters. The dance therapy can optimize the psychomotor behavior of young people with autistic disorders.
