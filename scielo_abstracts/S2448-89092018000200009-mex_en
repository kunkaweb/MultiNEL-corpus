Abstract: Mediterranean fever is an acute infectious disease included in the group of human rickettsiosis, caused by Rickettsia conorii, with geographic distribution circumscribed to the Mediterranean countries where it is considered endemic. In Spain, in the last two decades, there has been an increase in the incidence and presence of cases in geographical regions other than the endemic area described by the name of the disease, which has been correlated with the high temperatures and the low level of precipitations. It is a generally benign with low mortality associated. Its clinical spectrum varies from asymptomatic cases to an exceptional «malignant» form characterized by an important visceral compromise, especially renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation with purpuric rash, severe hepatic alteration, pulmonary infiltrates and altered level of consciousness. We describe the case of a patient with Malignant Mediterranean fever that evolved favorably.
