Abstract: Neuropathy due to entrapment of the suprascapular nerve (SSN) is relatively rare, however, it should be known because it is a potentially treatable cause of painful shoulder. In this report two clinical cases treated by surgery are presented. These were two men aged 42 and 56 who consulted for pain and functional impotence for abduction and external rotation of the shoulder. Case 2 had a clear motor deficit (M2 of the BMC scale). Since they did not improve with physical rehabilitation, posterior decompression was performed with satisfactory results in both cases. Early diagnosis is of paramount importance to avoid its progression, since if there is muscle atrophy there may be incomplete recovery of abduction and external rotation of the shoulder.
