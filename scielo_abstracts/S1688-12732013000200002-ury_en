A case of a patient with chronic low back pain with an implanted intrathecal morphine infusion pump is reported. Lower systemic opioid requirement and a better pain control were observed. Pain intensity diminished 50% the first year and 75% at 6 years. The walking interference lessened 25% the first year and 50% at 6 years, in the meantime the enjoyment of life interference lowed 37.5% the first year and 62.5% at 6 years. No hospitalization for pain control was necessary. Although a dose escalation of intrathecal morphine was observed, the larger dose needed was 1.16 mg/d. No dangerous complications were noticed and the others were acceptably managed, with the exception of the sexual disturbance that needs diagnostic and eventual treatment. The patient expressed satisfaction with the kind of analgesic system applied. We conclude that intrathecal morphine infusion pump was effective to manage the patientÂ´s pain, reaching better pain control, lower intake of systemic opioids, and functional as well as quality of life improvement.
