Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) integrates dystrophy occurring due to genetic mutations that express the dystrophin protein in chromosome X. The onset of neuromuscular symptoms usually precedes the impairment of cardiac function, and may conversely happen by heart failure (HF). Physical training is well established in HF, however, when combined with BMD, it is controversial and without any scientific basis. This study presents the case of a patient with BMD associated with HF in cardiac transplant waiting list undergoing a physical training program.
