Summary: Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of infrequent genodermatoses characterized by cutaneous fragility and blisters or erosions after minor skin trauma. This paper presents the case of a 15-day-old breastfed infant diagnosed with Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS), it was based on clinical manifestations and electron microscopy evidence and had a subsequent favourable evolution. The case illustrates an infrequent disease and demonstrates the relevance of providing appropriate treatment immediately after childbirth, as well as the value of a multidisciplinary approach to the disease, since it has a high impact on the patients' quality of life.
