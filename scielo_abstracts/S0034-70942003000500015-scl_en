This study aimed at evaluating the prevalence of Ag-HBs, anti-HBs and anti-HBc among anesthesiologists of the city of Goiânia, as well as their vaccination status. METHODS: Participated in this study 90 out of 200 anesthesiologists of the city of Goiânia. Samples were collected by the author and consisted of 10 ml blood of a peripheral vein identified at collection. Blood was analyzed in the first 24 hours, under optimal conservation conditions. The following markers were detected by immunoenzymatic essay: anti-HBc, anti-HBs and Ag-HBs.

RESULTS: Analyzed material showed that 65 out of 90 (72.2%) were anti-HBs positive, as compared to 25 out of 90 (27.8%) who were negative. As to anti-HBc, 76 out of 10 (90.5%) were negative and 9 out of 90 (10%) were positive. No participant was Ag-HBs-positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown 72.2% serum prevalence for anti-HBs. The prevalence of Hepatitis-B infection among anesthesiologists was 8.9%, represented by 8 anti-HBc + / anti-HBs +. Based on these results, vaccination campaigns and successful prevention should be intensified.
