SUMMARY Kinsbourne syndrome, also known as “Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome” or “Dancing eyes syndrome” is a rare condition characterized by rapid, irregular, multi-directional eye movements (opsoclonus), myoclonic movements in the trunk, face and/or limbs and ataxia. It occurs in children aged between 6 and 36 months. Its etiology may be paraneoplasic (neuroblastoma), non-paraneoplasic (infectious processes) or idiopathic. Regardless of its etiology, immunosuppressive drugs have been used in order to reduce the formation of antibodies possibly involved in the pathophysiology. We report the case of a 21 month-old girl with this syndrome secondary to an infectious respiratory illness. She had ataxia, opsoclonus, upper limbs myoclonus, irritability and altered sleep pattern. Neuroblastoma was ruled out. Initial management was done with methylprednisolone pulses, followed by oral prednisolone. She had progressive clinical improvement, and is currently asymptomatic with no sequelae. In these patients a paraneoplasic syndrome should always be ruled out.
