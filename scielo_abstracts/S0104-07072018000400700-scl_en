ABSTRACT  Objective: to describe the experience of developing an electronic health record in physiotherapy based on the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health through the mapping and cross-referencing of clinical evaluation information, diagnosis and physiotherapeutic interventions.  Method: an experience report, organized in four stages: Theoretical development of the International Classification of Functionality; Theoretical development of evaluation in physiotherapy; Structuring of evaluation data, diagnoses and physiotherapeutic intervention; Computerization and systematized integration of data from clinical evaluation, diagnoses and interventions.  Results: the structure of the data was divided by systems of the human body. Thus, for the respiratory system, 15 evaluation topics, 145 diagnoses and 74 interventions were constructed; for the neuromusculoskeletal system, 37 evaluation topics, 132 diagnoses and 65 interventions were constructed; for the cardiovascular system, five evaluation topics, 23 diagnoses and five interventions were constructed and seven assessment topics, 21 diagnoses and one intervention were constructed for the gastrointestinal and renal systems. Thus, 64 evaluation items were constructed, 318 diagnoses based on the Functionality Classification and 145 physiotherapeutic interventions.  Conclusion: the mapping of information regarding physiotherapeutic evaluation, diagnoses and interventions to integrate an electronic physiotherapy records will make use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health safer and faster, allowing it to be applied in the hospital setting.
