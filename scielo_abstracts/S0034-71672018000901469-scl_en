ABSTRACT  Objective: to report the nurses' experience in relation to the training of caregivers of infants with Isolated Robin Sequence (IRS) for maintaining care after hospital discharge from the perspective of Self-Care Theoretical Framework.  Method: the following categories were considered in this experience report: self-care action, self-care capacity, therapeutic self-care demand, self-care deficit, and nursing system. The nursing system was wholly compensatory and supportive-educative.  Results: caregivers' training by nurses results in the acquisition of technical skills and specific knowledge related to the infant's positioning in elevated ventral decubitus, nasopharyngeal intubation, feeding-facilitating techniques and care with the feeding tube.  Final considerations: the continuity of home care is guaranteed from caregivers' training for the therapeutic demand.
