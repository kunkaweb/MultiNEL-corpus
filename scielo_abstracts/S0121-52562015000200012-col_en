Guillain Barre Syndrome is an autoimmune polyneuropathy that causes motor and sensory demyelination, often with a history of infection. The diagnosis is made by clinical suspicion, although the cerebrospinal fluid and electrodiagnostic studies help support it. The Physician should be familiar with the clinical variants such as facial diplegia and make an accurate diagnosis. IVIG and plasmapheresis are effective treatments. Supportive care during and after hospitalization is crucial.
