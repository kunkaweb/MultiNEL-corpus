Summary: Mohs surgery is a technique used for the excision of different types of skin cancer which enabled the histological study of the entire (100%) surgical margins, with maximum preservation of healthy tissue and leading to the highest healing rates. After surgery, several techniques are available to repair resulting defects, one of which is healing by second intention. The latter consists in allowing granulation tissue to be formed spontaneously, which can be assisted with hydrocolloid dressings to favor healing. The case of an old age female patient with three facial defects is described. Second intention healing was the choice, assisting it with hydrocolloid dressings.
