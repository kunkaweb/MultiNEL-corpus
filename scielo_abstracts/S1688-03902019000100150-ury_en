Abstract:   Introduction: Budd-Chiari is a rare condition characterized by the occlusion of the hepatic vein flow out. It is frequently associated to a pro-thrombotic state. Diagnosis and treatment constitute a challenge for clinical doctors. This study aims to report a clinical case of Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to an antiphospholipid syndrome, a rather unusual association in literature.   Clinical case:  31 year old woman, with 6 years of evolution ascites, evidencing a general affection in the last year. Clinical examination: lucid, universal hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice), painful hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and tension ascites. Laboratory tests: hepatogram with cholestatic pattern, cholinesterase, and reduced prothrombin rate. Abdominal Doppler revealed: severe ascites, irregular hepatomegaly, increased echogenicity. Splenomegaly. Occlusion of the middle suprahepatic vein, narrowing of the right suprahepatic vein. Llow speed scarcely phasic flow, inverse in a few branches, hepatofugal. Fibrogastroduodenoscopy: esophagic varices grade III. Ascites secondary to portal hypertension was suspected, probable Budd Chiari syndrome. Antibodies IgM Ã¢2glicoprotein 1 were positive. Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. Liver transplant was performed with a good evolution of the patient.   Discussion and conclusions:  Budd-Chiari syndrome is more frequent in women between 35 and 50 years old. It needs to be regarded as a cause of liver conditions, in particular when there is no other evident cause. Hematologic diseases are the prothrombotic states more frequently associated to Budd-Chiari syndrome in the western world. Treatment must be based on the clinical presentation. Liver transplant is a rescue/salvage measure when all other treatments fail.
