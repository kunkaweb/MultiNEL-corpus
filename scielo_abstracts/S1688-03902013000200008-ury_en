Summary Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is the most frequent form, accounting for 70% of the cases. It is an acquired autoimmune disease in which IgG antibodies target desmosomal proteins to produce intraepithelial, mucocutaneous blistering. Erosions of the scalp are a relatively ordinary clinical presentation. However, progressive loss of hair or discreet alopecic plaques are rarely described in patients with PV. The study presents a case of PV with progressive hair loss and alopecic zones.
