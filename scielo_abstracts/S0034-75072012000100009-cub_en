Amyloidosis is an uncommon complicated disease of a difficult diagnosis occurring due to the amyloid substance depot in the extracellular medium. Being diagnosed in the oral cavity, the patient must to be supervised to assess the potential systemic complications of disease. The aim of present paper was to present a case of oral amyloidosis in a female patient ages 72 presenting with traumatic fibroma. After performance of a biopsy and the histopathological examination, the diagnosis was the presence of amyloidosis, confirmed with the help of the sample using Congo red reactant. Amyloid depots were found in the conjunctive tissue which under the polarized light showed birefringence. This finding was worrying since the amyloidosis involves different tissues leading to systemic complications. Thus, the patient was oriented to search medical care; however she abandons treatment dying 6 months after diagnosis of the disease. The apparently single oral injuries may to reveal uncommon diseases and of difficult treatment. The precise treatment and the medical supervision are essential in the patient's survival.
