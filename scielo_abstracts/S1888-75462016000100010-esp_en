The aim of the study was to evaluate the immediate effect of Dynamic Tape® bandage on the external tibial torsion, clinically painful, and the contractile properties of the superficial muscles involved in a soccer player. The subject presented external tibial torsion with painful symptoms in the right lower extremity. Thigh-foot angle and the contractile properties of the superficial musculature by tensiomyography in both legs and perceived pain were measured. Dynamic Tape® bandage was applied for 10 days. A decrease in the thigh-foot angle of the right lower extremity and a 55% reduction in pain knee was observed. The stressed muscle showed a reduction of muscle activation while the weakened muscles increased muscle activation. In conclusion, in the case studied, the Dynamic Tape® can be considered a very effective complementary therapeutic tool to reduce external tibial torsion, clinically painful.
