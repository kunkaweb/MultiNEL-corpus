The aim of this study was to discuss the experience of building an educational software about the auscultation of breathing sounds. In the process, Lev Semenovic Vygotsky's pedagogic theoretical framework was used, and the content was delimited so as to encompass the auscultation method step by step. The objective of the auscultation was to classify normal and strange sounds and their particular stethoacoustic characteristics. For the development of the system was used 3D technology, including virtual personification of the patients, nurses and objects. A virtual environment for the auscultation using simulation procedures was used as well. It was concluded that initiatives such as that, although facing many difficulties, bring important contributions to teaching-learning of contents related to nursing education.
