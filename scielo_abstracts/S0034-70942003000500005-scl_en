BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Epidural clonidine has analgesic properties and potentiates local anesthetic effects; there are, however, some side effects including: arterial hypotension, bradycardia and sedation. This study aimed at evaluating analgesia and sedation of clonidine associated to 0.75% ropivacaine in the postoperative period of open cholecystectomy. METHODS: Participated in this study 30 patients of both genders, aged 18 to 50 years, weighing 50 to 100 kg, physical status ASA I or II, submitted to cholecystectomy, who were distributed in two groups: Control Group (CG) received 0.75% ropivacaine (20 ml) with saline solution (1 ml); Experimental Group (EG) received 0.75% ropivacaine (20 ml) with clonidine (1 ml = 150 Âµg). Analgesia and sedation were observed at 2, 6 and 24 postoperative hours. RESULTS: Mean age was 41 yr in CG and 37 yr in EG. Mean weight was 67 kg in CG and 64 kg to EG. Postoperative sedation was significantly higher at 2 and 6 hours in the Experimental Group. Analgesia was observed in more EG patients as compared to Control Group. CONCLUSIONS: The association of clonidine and ropivacaine has produced longer analgesia and sedation at 2 and 6 hours of observation.
