OBJECTIVE: To report the difficulties in managing a case of os odontoideum. METHODS: Female patient, 12 years old who developed a quadiparesis after minor cervical trauma in October 2005. In the emergency department a congenital cervical anomaly was identified. The patient was placed in a StrykerÂ® frame and, few days later, in a halo bracing. After 3 months, an infection around the pins emerged and the halo vest had to be removed. A severe C1-2 instability persisted and a C1-C2 Gallie procedure was attempted. In the following weeks the bone disappeared and another procedure was attempted in June 2006 - C1 laminectomy and occiput-C3 fusion. In the following months the neurological status of the patient improved and a complete mass of occiput-C3 fusion was observed. RESULTS: We choose a posterior cervical arthrodesis of C1-C2 using the Gallie technique. Since the condition was not resolved we performed a second surgery, C1 laminectomy (determined by SAC of 8, 3 mm in MRI) followed by posterior occiput-C3 fusion. In our case, until now, there is no evidence of axial decompensation, but a more prolonged follow-up is needed. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of os odontoideum has many considerations but the essential that in the presence of instability and neurological deficit a solid fusion is achieved. In case of failure of posterior atlantoaxial wiring, the occiput-C2 or C3 fusion with rods seems to be an excellent option with a high rate of success, avoiding the need for additional support.
