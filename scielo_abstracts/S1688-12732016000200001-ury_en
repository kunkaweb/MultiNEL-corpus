Summary: Malignant Hyperthermia (MH)is a clinical syndrome that occurs in susceptible patients after exposure to a triggering anesthetic agent. Associated mortality decreases with specific treatment, which is why its diagnosis and early treatment is essential. We present the case of a 3-year and 10-month-old girl, who presented a right hemiparesis. Possible demyelinating disease was suspected. Two previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed under general anesthesia without complications. Due to poor evolution of his disease, new MRI is performed with anesthesia. After the procedure, she presented an episode of dystonias, acidosis, elevated CPK. It was interpreted as MH, and specific treatment was initiated instated. We present this case with the objective of exposing a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this pathology.
