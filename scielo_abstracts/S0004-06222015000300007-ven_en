Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is found in milk and other excretion products after aflatoxin B1 intake. AFM1 is carcinogenic to humans, and known levels of dairy product contamination is important to understand the risks to which the population is exposed. The occurrence of AFM1 was evaluated in 42 milk samples commercialized in Londrina, Parana State, Brazil and this rate of occurrence was used to estimate this exposure. AFM1 determina tion was ca rried out by ELISA, and was detected in 100 % samples at levels ranging from 0.01 to 0.81 µ g/kg (mean 0.13 µ g/kg). None of the samples p resente d AFM1 above the maximum permitted level by Brazilian Legislation (0.5 µ g/kg for fluid milk and 5 µ g/kg for milk powder). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of AFM1 was evaluated, and the average intake was 0.468 ng/kg body weight (b.w.) for adolescents, 0.384 ng/kg b.w. for adults and 0.559 ng/kg b.w. for the elderly. Values of EDI of AFM1 found in Londrina pose a toxicological risk to the population investigated. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on estimat ed AFM1 dietary exposure from Parana, Brazil.
