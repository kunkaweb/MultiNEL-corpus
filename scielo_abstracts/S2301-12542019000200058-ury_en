Abstract: The exposed erect dislocation of the shoulder is a very low frequency lesion association in the pediatric age. The physical and epiphyseal lesions are more frequent than the dislocations and ligament injuries. This is due to the presence of a bone tissue with great elastic deformity power and a thick periosteum. We present a clinical case of an 11-year-old patient who suffered an exposed erect dislocation of the right shoulder, due to a fall of 1 meter and a half high. The treatment consisted of emergency surgical cleaning, humeral gleno reduction and empirical antibiotic therapy, penicinila 400,000 IU/kg/day divided every 6 hours and gentamicin 3mg/Kg/day divided every 8 hours for 10 days, immobilization for 3 weeks with a sling followed by rehabilitation, and a follow-up of 2 years at the end of which the patient did not present functional sequelae in the right glenohumeral joint.
