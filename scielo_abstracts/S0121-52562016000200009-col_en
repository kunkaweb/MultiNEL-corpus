Littre's hernia is a disease of unknown incidence, it's clinical suspicion is infrequent given the lack of specificity of the symptoms, therefore it's diagnosis is made intrasurgicaly. We report the case of a patient that consulted due to acute abdominal pain, irreducible and painful mass in the right inguinal region, who since admission was suspected of having a strangulated hernia. After an emergency surgery the intraoperative finding of perforated Littre hernia was performed. The patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day in good general conditions.
