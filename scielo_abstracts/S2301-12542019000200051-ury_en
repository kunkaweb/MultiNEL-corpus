Abstract: Anal melanoma (MA) is an infrequent tumor, characterized by aggressive behavior and poor prognosis(1). The nonspecific symptomatology and its similarity with benign anorectal etiologies, makes the diagnosis difficult and leads to a delay in it(2)(3).Therefore, a thorough physical examination and a high index of suspicion are necessary. The case of a patient who consulted for a non-pigmented and painful anal mass with rectal bleeding is discussed; which is diagnosed with anal melanoma.
