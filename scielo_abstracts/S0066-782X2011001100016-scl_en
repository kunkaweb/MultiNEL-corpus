This is the case of 28 year-old adult with suspected congenital heart disease since birth, not treated in childhood at the his family's choice. At 27 years old, he was diagnosed with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and systemic-pulmonary collaterals, where surgery was contraindicated. A new review in our department showed that it was an atypical form of truncus arteriosus. The fact that a common arterial trunk with left-right shunt was viewed by echocardiography was a crucial fact for the indication of new catheterization, opening the prospect of surgical correction. Currently, the patient is well, with 7 years of postoperative outcome.
