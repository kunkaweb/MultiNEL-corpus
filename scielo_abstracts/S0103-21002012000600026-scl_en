OBJECTIVE: To describe the validation process of an educational technology for patients undergoing orthognathic surgery, through the application of the Delphi technique. METHODS: Participating in the study were ten experts (four maxillofacial surgeons, two nurses, two nutritionists and two speech therapists) who indicated the subjects to be covered in the material for the first phase of the Delphi technique. After constructing the material and obtaining the results of the first phase, the second and third phases of this technique were initiated with validation of the pertinence of the information contained in this educational technology. RESULTS: In the second round we obtained at least 90.0% agreement in all categories. In the third, the following improvements were noted: 12% for the content item, 6.7% for language, 12.5% for illustrations, 3.3% for layout, 10% for culture; the motivation item was unchaged. CONCLUSION: The Delphi technique can be an important tool in the construction and validation of educational technologies.
