OBJECTIVE: To show that it is possible to diagnose fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva in the primary health care. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 10-year-old female patient that has developed, since the age of 4, progressive stiffness of the joints and spine and ossification of soft tissues, often associated with trauma. The hallux valgus deviation of both toes was present from birth. X-ray showed the presence of heterotopic ossification. COMMENTS: This disease is likely to be diagnosed with the resources available in primary health care, since it is based on clinical findings. Currently, there is no cure for this disease, but high doses of corticosteroids and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which are available in the primary care level, may limit the development of new calcifications and mitigate the pain, improving the quality of life of these patients.
