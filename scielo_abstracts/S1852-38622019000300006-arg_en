Rupture of the ventricular septum is a recognized serious complication of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Two tipes of myocardial rupture have been previously described: simple and complex (hemorrhagic dissection or dissecting intramyocardial hematoma). This presentation reports the case of a patient with AMI complicated with a large ventricular septal defect in the inferior septum interventricular with communication between the right and left ventricles.
