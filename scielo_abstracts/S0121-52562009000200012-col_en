The primary intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma of the mandible is classified by the World Health Organization within the odontogenic carcinomas. It is a rare disease. Epidemiologically the male: female ratio is 3,5:1. The highest incidence is in the fifth and sixth decades of life. The most affected area is the posteroinferior mandibular region. It is a locally aggressive tumor that metastasizes to regional lymph nodes. The clinical diagnosis is difficult, because their behavior is intraosseous so it can last long periods of time before the diagnosis is made. It requires a pathological study which detects the presence of intraoseus carcinomatous epithelial cells. Imaging shows a radiolucent lesion with osteolysis in the form of atypical cystic lesions poorly defined in most cases. The treatment of choice for curative purposes is to provide an excision with wide safety margins and subsequent reconstructive surgery. We present a 31 years old patient with a primary mandibular intraosseous squamous cell carcinoma (solid type), whose treatment consisted of an en bloc resection and right mandibular reconstructive surgeries to obtain an adequate functional and aesthetic result.
