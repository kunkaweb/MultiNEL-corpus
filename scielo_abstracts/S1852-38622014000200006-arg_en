Ebstein's anomaly is characterized by the abnormal implantation of the septal leaflet and often the posterior leaflet into the right ventricle. The syndrome of right ventricular dysfunction is an unusual presentation of this disease in adulthood. We report the case of a male patient, 41 years old, admitted with decompensated heart failure after a year of research undiagnosed. We discuss the pathophysiology and outcome of patients with Ebstein's anomaly, with emphasis on the variability of clinical presentations.
