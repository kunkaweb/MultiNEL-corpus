Abstract: The ganglionopathies correspond to a group of pathologies with soma involvement of the first sensory neuron of the dorsal root ganglion and Gasser's ganglion. There are two main etiological categories, acquired and hereditary, with a different clinical and evolutionary profile. The manifestations depend on the type of compromised neuron, the larger ones (A beta and delta fibers) lead to proprioceptive sensitivity and its alteration is translated as sensory ataxia. The smaller ones (C fibers) lead to thermoalgesic sensitivity and their alteration is translated by neuropathic pain. The picture is generally diffuse, symmetric and given by purely sensitive symptoms (apalestesia/hipopalestesia, sensory ataxia and/or neuropathic pain), absent reflexes and without motor deficit. The temporal evolution itâ€™s variable. The neurophysiological profile is defined by decreased amplitudes or absence of sensory nervous action potentials (SNAP) with multifocal distribution and conserved compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) or with slight alterations. Functional prognosis is generally poor, with limited recovery. We will present the clinical and neurophysiological aspects of a patient evaluated in our service.
