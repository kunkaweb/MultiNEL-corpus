This paper describes an experience that occurred in the municipality of Uruoca-CE, Brazil, where nurses from the Family Health Strategy involved a group of teenagers in practices of health promotion. Pregnant women were chosen as priority because of their resistance to perform dental consultation and small family participation in prenatal care. It was built up a play for the pregnant women and their families, focusing on the theme, in which the adolescents were the writers, set designers and actors. There was a significant involvement of the teenager group in planning and implementing of the activities, as well as greater understanding of the relationship between community participation and health promotion. As a result, it was observed an increase in the family participation in the prenatal cares and in the dental calls.
