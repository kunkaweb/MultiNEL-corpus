The quadricuspid aortic valve is a rare congenital anomaly, which usually presents as an isolated malformation causing aortic regurgitation more frequently in the fifth or sixth decade of life. The first reported cases were found at autopsies or became evident in surgical findings. Currently, echocardiography and other diagnostic imaging methods allow earlier diagnosis, even in asymptomatic patients. The case of a 53-year-old man with quadricuspid aortic valve diagnosed by echocardiography and complicated with the development of severe valve stenosis is presented. A brief discussion of the disease is included.
