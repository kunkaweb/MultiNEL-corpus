We evaluated the case of a patient with Papillary Fibroelastoma (PFE) that presented embolization to the upper right limb. The patient was submitted to percutaneous embolectomy, with fragment removal. The diagnosis was confirmed by transthoracic echocardiogram and anatomopathological analysis of the fragment. The patient chose to undergo the conservative clinical treatment and the follow-up has shown good evolution with no disease recurrence to date. We decided to use this rare and interesting case with the objective of reviewing the current literature and discuss the best therapeutic management.
