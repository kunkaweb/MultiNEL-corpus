ABSTRACT The aims of this article are to present cervical spondylotic myelopathy, a spinal condition caused by bony, ligament and disc alterations that results in spinal cord compression leading to progressive degeneration of the spinal cord, and to describe the possible physiotherapeutic interventions. The pathology has different forms of progression and affected areas, which contributes to the diversity of clinical presentations. This work presents two evaluations of three patients diagnosed with this disease, at different times, to compare the severity, the affected regions, and the evolution of each one. Subsequently, it describes the most appropriate physiotherapeutic treatment for this illness, demonstrating its wide variability according to the signs and symptoms presented. Level of Evidence: IV. Case series.
