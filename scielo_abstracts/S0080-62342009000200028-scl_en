We aimed to describe the instructions that Alzheimer patient caregivers receive before they participating in the Neuro-geriatrics Center; analyze the applicability of the instructions received at the Neuro-geriatrics Center in everyday home care; and identify the coping and adaptation mechanisms found in these caregivers. We adopted a qualitative approach, in this descriptive-exploratory case study. The chosen technique for data collection was the semi-structured interview. Subjects were 15 caregivers seen at a Federal Hospital in Rio de Janeiro. Data analysis was performed using thematic content analysis, and three categories were obtained: Instructions received before participating in the Neuro-geriatrics Center; Instructions received at the Neuro-geriatrics Center; Coping and adaptation mechanisms within the context of family care. It is concluded that the coping mechanisms are used to adapt to overload situations, which can be relieved through the educational and emotional support received in the orientation groups.
