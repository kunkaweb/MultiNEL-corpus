Abstract  Introduction: Pemphigus vulgaris is a rare autoimmune disease of the skin and mucous membranes, its etiology is unknown and has a high mortality rate. The manifestations of this pathology are common in the oral cavity, so the dentist has a great responsibility in making a timely diagnosis, thus improving the prognosis.   Case presentation:   A 63-year-old female patient with a pemphigus vulgaris diagnosis and lesions in the oral cavity and skin. The treatment was performed in teamwork between the departments of stomatology and dermatology. The systemic management was with prednisolone in high doses that diminished in determined periods of time; also immunosuppressive, antihistaminic, antibiotics and antimycotics medication was conducted. To treat lesions in the oral cavity, a master formula composed of hydrocortisone, vitamins A and E, low molecular weight glycerin and xylocaine in Orabase were applied to the lesions. The treatment was carried out for four months, after the first week, the resolution of the symptomatology in the oral cavity and skin was achieved; complete healing of all lesions was reached and no relapse was recorded after completion of treatment.   Conclusion:   The literature agrees that prednisolone is the drug of choice to treat this condition, it is found that a timely diagnosis would avoid the use of these drugs in high doses and for long periods of time, thus avoiding adverse reactions. The use of the master formula for lesions in the oral cavity is not reported in the literature and therefore its disclosure is considered important.
