ABSTRACT A 16-days-old female patient exhibiting an exophytic nodular lesion located at anterior maxilla on the alveolar ridge since birth. The clinical hypothesis of congenital granular cell epulis (CGCE) was established, and the patient underwent excisional biopsy. Microscopically, a sheet-like proliferation of eosinophilic cells with granular cytoplasm was observed in a stroma of vascularized fibrous connective tissue. The immunohistochemical analysis for S100 evidenced the absence of immunostaining. The CGCE hypothesis was confirmed and, after six months, the patient showed no signs of recurrence of the lesion.
