ABSTRACT The dental follicle is characterized as a radiolucent area around an impacted tooth. It is believed that these follicles can originate cysts and tumors. The aim of this study was to report a clinical case of a 15-year-old female, normosystemic patient, with an increased dental follicle involving the crown of the tooth 48, which was removed and referred for histopathological examination. The diagnosis hypothesis was dentigerous cyst, but the histopathological report describes a definitive diagnosis of dental follicle. After six months of postoperative follow-up the patient presented no signs of relapse or complaints in the region.
