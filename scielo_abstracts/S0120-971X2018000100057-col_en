Abstract Dentigerous cyst is the most common developmental odontogenic cyst. It can involve any included tooth, although molars and canines are most frequently affected, followed by premolars and incisors. The aim of this article was to report the case of an 11-year-old female patient complaining of an eruption delay of a mandibular second premolar (45). Therefore, a literature review regarding the diagnosis and treatment of this condition is presented. At clinical and radiographic examination, the image suggested a dentigerous cyst; however, the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) exams. Surgical planning was carried out using a conservative method involving surgical decompression. CBCT was used as a surgical guide. At 4-month clinical and radiographic follow-up, cystic enucleation was performed by curettage. The patient was followed for 3 years until complete eruption and alignment of the teeth occurred. No lesion was recorded, and orthodontic treatment was proven to be successful. The surgical decompression was completely safe, avoiding damage in important structures, and resulted in rapid recovery of the patient.
