The purpose of this case study was to apply nursing diagnoses and interventions based on the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) Taxonomy of Nursing Diagnoses and the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) on an adolescent with secondary mellitus to cystic fibrosis and on her caretaker in order to provide them full care and guidelines. The nursing interventions were based on the following diagnoses: ineffective confrontation and stress syndrome due to alterations. These references helped us develop effective nursing interventions that provided a framework for individualized care, in addition to promoting a standardized nursing language.
