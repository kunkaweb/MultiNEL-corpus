Abstract: The primary central nervous system vasculitis (VPSNC) refers to a group of diseases that result from inflammation and destruction of the blood vessels of the spinal cord, brain and meninges, both in the venous and arterial sector. The presentation is heterogeneous and unsystematized. The diagnosis is made based on compatible symptoms, supported by an angiography showing evidence of vasculitis and/or biopsy of the brain parenchyma or meninges. Alterations in imaging studies are consistent but nonspecific for diagnostic and are usually accompanied by alterations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We present a clinical case of probable VPSNC based on clinical presentation and findings on imagenological studies suggestive vasculitis, along with alterations in CSF and EEG. Treatment was based on Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents with poor response and evolution.
