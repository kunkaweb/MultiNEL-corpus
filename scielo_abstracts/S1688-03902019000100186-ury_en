Abstract: The study presents the case of a 40 year old female patient who consulted for asthenia, adynamia, dizziness and progressive dyspnea with 10 months of evolution, evidencing intermittent solid dysphagia in the last 4 months. Barium X-rays of the esophagus evidenced subcricoid stenosis with good distal passage and the gastroscopy immediately showed a stenosing fibrous membrane under the cricopharyngeal. Iron oral treatment was initiated and several sessions with a balloon catheter which solved the symptoms. Plummer-inson syndrome is a rare entity characterized by iron deficiency anemia, dysphagia and a high esophageal membrane.
