Life expectancy of over 60 years for 2020 reveals that an important nunber of women will experience the menopause, and this requires appropriate health measures. Therefore, this systematic review is to characterize the scientific literature on the experience of women in the climacteric. The search was conducted through the Virtual Health Library (VHL) with descriptors climacteric and women's health in a period from 2004 to 2010 and 13 field research papers in LILACS were subsequently selected, on account of their presenting experiences in the climacteric. The analysis found the folowing categories: climacteric as a psycho-physiological stage of life, for a healthy life in climacteric and health actions aimed at menopausal women. We conclude that there is a need to effectively link the phenomenon of menopause in public health policy in Brazil and the expansion of health services to meet the demand and comprehensive care to women undergoing menopause.
