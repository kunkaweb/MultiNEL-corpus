ABSTRACT This article reports a case of large volume asymptomatic staghorn calculus, and a brief revision of this rare pathology is done. A two-yearold male patient was diagnosed with staghorn calculus and hydronephrosis in the left kidney. The patient underwent surgical therapy with pyelolithotomy, pyeloplasty and placement of a double-J catheter, without complications. Staghorn calculi occupy the pelvis and renal calyces. Their incidence in children is lower than in adults. The average age at diagnosis is between 7 and 10 years. The etiology for calculi is diverse; in children under 4 years, it is especially related with infectious factors and hydronephrosis. The standard procedure for treatment is percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
