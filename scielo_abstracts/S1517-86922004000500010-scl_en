The objective of this study was to analyze the intra (IT) and extra cellular (ET) triglycerides consumption in the soleus, tibialis anticus, vastus internus muscles, after 4 hours training ride on the road. This study used a top-level cyclist as a case study. Magnetic resonance studies used the following spectroscopy parameters imposed to adjust the time, such as the distance of the frequency between the signs IT and ET of the similar chemical nature. We were able to conclude that the vastus internus was the muscle which demonstrated the largest triglyceride consumption as the energetic substrate after a 4 hour bike ride on the road. Thus, we can infer that a workout at 80% of the VO2max enabled the consumption of intra muscle triglyceride during exercise.
