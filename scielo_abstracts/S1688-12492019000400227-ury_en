Summary: Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune disease that affects skin and mucous membranes. The main lesions result from acantholysis caused by IgG antibody deposits on the desmosomesâ€™ glycoproteins. In newborns, it is caused by the passive passage of maternal antibodies (IgG) through the placenta. The most frequent pemphigus subtypes in newborns are pemphigus vulgaris and foliaceus. This is a case report of a neonatal pemphigus vulgaris, which evolved to a full remission of the bullous lesions, without the need immunosuppressive treatment.
