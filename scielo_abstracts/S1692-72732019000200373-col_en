Abstract  Introduction:  The solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (SFTP) is an uncommon pathology. It corresponds to less than 5 % of the primary tumors of the pleura. Even much rare is to find one solitary fibrous tumor, of more than 15 cm in patients younger than 35 years since the incidence peak is between 60 to 70 years. There has been only one case reported in Colombia.  Case presentation:  The subject of study was a 33-year-old female patient, no exposure to asbestos or cigarette. The chief complaints of the patient were mild dyspnea and right dorsal pain. Thoracic contrast-enhanced computerized tomography showed a large solid mass of lobulated contours that compromised 70 % of the right hemithorax, of extrapulmonary origin compressing the right atrium. Immunohistochemistry of the percutaneous biopsy demonstrated a solitary fibrous tumor. The patient underwent an extended right posterolateral thoracotomy. We found and completely resected a tumor hanging on the right parietal pleura. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry of the product of the surgical resection were compatible with a solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura, 30 x 23 x 16cm in size, and no malignancy. The evolution after surgery was satisfactory with an early hospital discharge.  Discussion:  In a young patient, a giant TFSP is unusual. After diagnosis and despite having some characteristics that suggested malignancy: its size and origin in the parietal pleura, surgical resection was the appropriate procedure for this tumor, with subsequent histopathological confirmation compatible with a benign tumor.
