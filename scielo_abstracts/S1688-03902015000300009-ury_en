Abstract Reconstruction of full thickness thoracic wall defects remains a controversial topic, with older osteosynthesis materials complication rates ranging from 46 to 69%. Recent introduction of titanium in the making of the plates, makes this material ideal for this type of procedures due to being stainless, chemically inert and the fact that the ribs adapt correctly to the thorax shape. We present the case of a 56 year old male, with Von Recklinghausen disease in whom we performed a resection of an anteroateral chest wall tumor, which included four costal arches and the corresponding cartilage. Reconstruction with titanum plates and prolene mesh was performed. The patient had no postoperative complications. This ostesynthesis system with titanium plates matrix rib provides both functional, safe and good cosmetic results.
