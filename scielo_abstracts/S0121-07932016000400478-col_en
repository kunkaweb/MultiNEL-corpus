SUMMARY Spasticity may cause immobility, prostration, chronic pain, bedsores, infections, thrombosis and pneumonia; the purposes of its treatment are to control pain, improve mobility and quality of life, and reincorporate the patient to its daily activities by means of oral anti-spastic drugs; however, patients suffering from severe spasticity may require high oral doses of these medications, which may lead to adverse effects. In such cases, intrathecal baclofen has been proposed as a solution. This procedure has not been widely used in Colombia, so that protocols to perform it have not been established. We report the results obtained with the intrathecal administration of baclofen in four severely spastic patients, who had not previously responded to oral anti-spastic drugs, including high doses of baclofen. Pain, spasticity and quality of life significantly improved in three of them. The remaining one presented tolerance to the medication. Intrathecal baclofen pump is a useful and safe procedure for patients with severe spasticity and poor response to oral treatment.
