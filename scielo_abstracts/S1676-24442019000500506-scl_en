ABSTRACT Pycnodysostosis is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic condition, which causes a decrease in bone remodeling, resulting in different clinical and radiographic manifestations. This case series aims to describe two clinical cases diagnosed at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Traumatology of a University on the Northeast of Brazil. There are two complex cases involving osteomyelitis and dental and bone alterations of the jaws. It is concluded that the knowledge of oral and maxillofacial characteristics of this syndrome are required to plan appropriate treatment for patient in order to avoid complications of dental treatments due to inadequate bone remodeling.
