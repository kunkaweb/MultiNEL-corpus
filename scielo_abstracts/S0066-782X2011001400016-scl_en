Lactococcus garvieae, an emerging zoonotic pathogen, is responsible for mastitis in rodents and sepsis in fish. Although deemed opportunistic and hardly ever causing infections in humans, its incidence is probably underestimated due to the difficulty in diagnosis. There are very few reports of osteomyelitis, liver abscess, and peritonitis, and only nine cases of endocarditis described in worldwide literature. We describe the first case of Lactococcus garvieae endocarditis in Latin America, in a female patient with metallic prosthetic heart valve who presented with daily fever, chills, Osler nodes and six positive blood cultures for Lactococcus garvieae, which met Duke's criteria for the diagnosis of "definitive infective endocarditis"
