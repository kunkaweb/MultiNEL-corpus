Globicatella sanguinis is a rare pathogenic microorganism Gram-positive cocci and catalase negative, which al-though is isolated in sheep, has been described as infectious agent causing meningitis in humans. The first description of this pathogen was made by Colins et al. in 1992, it's necessary to outline that before this event, part of the cases reported as a meningitis cause by S. viridans could actually be caused by G. sanguinis due to the lack of identification of these ones and the great similarity in terms of morphology and results of biochemical tests. However, after 20 years of the original description, the available information of G. sanguinis is limited. A case of meningitis associated with G. sanguinis following a surgical procedure has been reported in a 1-year-old patient at the Central Military Hospital.
