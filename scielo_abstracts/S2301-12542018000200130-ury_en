Abstract:  Introduction: Bone transport is the slow transportation of the bone fragment along a bone defect, providing distraction osteogenesis.  Objective:  To describe the surgical technique of bone transport using the AO external fixator and to present the result of this procedure in tibial diafisis defects of more than 4 cm long, which were the result of severe open fractures or infected no unions.  Material and Methods:  This is a retrospective, descriptive study of 14 patients treated in several centers in Montevideo from April 2011 to April 2015.  Results:  The average age of the patients was 32 years (15-32), the average bone loss 6,7 cm (4-11), the distraction speed 0,58 mm/day, the mean distraction period 92 days (35-172) and the mean time external fixation was 194 days. The mean follow up was 13 months (6-27). All patients needed an additional surgical procedure in the docking site. Bone healing was accomplished in 9 patients and there were 2 no unions. There were 2 further patients who abandoned the treatment and another patient who requested amputation. At the latest follow up there was no recurrence of infection.  Conclusion:  Bone transport using AO external fixator, is a valid alternative for the treatment of segmental bone loss of the diafisis of the tibia with or without infection.
