Summary: The lumbar syndrome is a congenital disorder that appears due to a segmental hemangioma located in the lumbosacral region and that is linked to congenital abnormalities in the same region. Possible correlations to this disorder are described in the LUMBAR acronym: Lower body infantile hemangioma, Lipoma, Urogenital anomalies, Ulceration, Myelopathy, Bone deformities, Anorectal malformations, Arterial anomalies, and Renal anomalies. We hereby introduce the case of a newborn with an arrested growth hemangioma and a genitourinary malformation diagnosed with lumbar syndrome based on the search and finding of the other correlations described by the acronym. We emphasize the importance of clinical suspicion of lesions linked to lumbosacral hemangiomas, since early detection may lead to the diagnosis of lesions without clear clinical evidence, which may alter patients' prognoses.
