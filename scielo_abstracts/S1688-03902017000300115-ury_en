Abstract: Carcinoma of the colon in an incarcerated inguinal hernia is rather an unusual condition. Few cases have been reported in literature. Usually it appears in left inguinal hernias and involves the sigmoid colon. Palpation of a tumor in a hernia that did not exist previously and the presentation of intestinal symptoms aid diagnosis. Barium enema constitutes the gold standard in paraclinical studies to confirm diagnosis. Surgical treatment is advised, although several tactics and approaches are possible. The study presents the clinical case of an 82 year-old patient with sigmoid colon cancer in an incarcerated left inguinal hernia which appeared as a tumor in the hernia and alterations in the intestinal alterations. The ultrasound suggested a possible diagnosis and the Barium enema confirmed the intrinsic colon lesion. Both lesions were solved by an inguinal approach. An oncological sigmoidectomy was performed and herniorrhaphy with no complications with a satisfactory oncological resection was achieved.
