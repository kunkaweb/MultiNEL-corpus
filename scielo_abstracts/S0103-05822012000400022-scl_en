OBJECTIVE: To report the case of an adolescent with undiagnosed hypothyroidism who sought dental clinic care due to delayed tooth eruption. Multiprofessionalwork enabled the diagnosis. CASE DESCRIPTION: This is a 16 years and 4 month-old patient whose initial complaint was delayed tooth eruption. Dental evaluation drew attention to the significant delay in tooth eruption as it could be related to organic diseases. This has prompted the intervention of medical professionals who diagnosed hypothyroidism in the follow-up. COMMENTS: Teenagers typically value acceptance by their peers and may have aesthetic concerns that lead them to seek health services for seemingly trivial complaints. A high degree of surveillance in these cases can detect more serious underlying organic problems. We highlight the importance of the multidisciplinary team in this approach.
