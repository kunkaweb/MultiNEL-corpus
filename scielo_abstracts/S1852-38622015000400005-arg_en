The incidence of acute aortic syndrome (aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer rupture of the vessel wall) is 2-3.5 cases per 100,000 people each year; but the retrograde type A aortic dissection is rare and only isolated cases have been reported, sometimes as a result of surgery. We report a case of a 62-year-old, who came to the emergency for chest pain relieved with analgesics and both chest radiography and electrocardiography were normal. On the third day began with fever that lasted for four weeks and disappeared spontaneously, was discharged with all studies normal and negatives cultives. Two weeks later admitted again by dyspnea on exertion, this was progressing. On admission to hospital clinical signs of pericarditis it is found, including pericardium rubbing, performing echocardiography and CT angiography, where the diagnosis of type B aortic dissection complicated with retrograde type A aortic dissection and hemopericardium was demonstrated.
