ABSTRACT An academic experience report of the university extension project: Mutual Help Group for Relatives of Elderly Living with Alzheimer's or Related Diseases. Alzheimer's is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, which is part of the group of dementias, being characterized by the deterioration of the mental functions resulting in cognitive impairment. Therefore, the family caregivers of elderly patients with Alzheimer's needs care and guidance to promote management and care for themselves and for the patients. It is important to involve health professionals in this scenario, especially nurses, acting directly in the health education process. Thus, the academic involvement in the extension project enriches the college education based on the contact with a certain community and, in this context, provides for further interaction with the complexity involving families and elderly people with Alzheimer's.
