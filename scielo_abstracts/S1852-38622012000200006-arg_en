Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a common cause of secondary cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology. It is characterized by the presence of congestive heart failure (CHF) in the mother in the last month of pregnancy or until five months after birth with left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the absence of other causes of heart failure in previously healthy women. Medical treatment consists of neurohormonal blockade, inotropic support, reduced pre-and post-cardiac load and anticoagulation. Heart transplantation is reserved for severe cases refractory to medical therapy. The prognosis is variable: approximately 50-60% of patients recover full cardiac function, in most cases in the first six months. We report the case of a black woman of 37 years, multiparous, prenatal without complications, comorbidities or previous drug use that developed CHF, sudden onset, demonstrated ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography 15 days after childbirth normal. There was no clinical suspicion of non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) which gave rise to doubt about the diagnosis of PPCM, since this is a diagnosis of exclusion. The presence of NCC was ruled out by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
