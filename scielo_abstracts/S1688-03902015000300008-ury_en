Abstract Given diagnostic-therapeutic implications of a fast growing tumor in the thyroid, it is natural to think of undifferentiated cancer and thyroid lymphoma, a low frequency entity that entails a diagnostic challenge for the medical team. Type B non-Hodking lymphomas (NHL) are the most frequent ones. The high rate of cell proliferation makes them sensitive to polychemotherapy treatment. Objective: the clinical case of a thyroid lymphoma of a questionable immunohistochemical classification is presented. Conclusion: thyroid lymphomas are unusual, and they will be ruled out upon a fast growing thyroid mass, always considering it as a differential diagnosis. A multidisciplinary team must be involved in the treatment, based on initial polychemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgery being a controversial therapy.
