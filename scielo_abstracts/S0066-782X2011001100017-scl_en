Report of three cases of chylothorax and one case of chylous ascites in children who had undergone cardiac surgery with no response to routine clinical treatment, based on fasting and long-term parenteral nutrition. Treatment with octreotide at an initial dose of 1.0 mcg/kg/h was chosen, with a gradual increase of 1.0 mcg/kg/hr/day until a maximum dose of 4.0 mcg/kg/h. All cases had a favorable response, with gradual reduction of drainage output until prognosis improvement with no significant side effects.
