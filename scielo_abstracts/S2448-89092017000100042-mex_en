Abstract: Refeeding syndrome is a commonly under diagnosed pathology, with potentially fatal outcomes when untreated. Nowadays few data exists about its prevalence. The clinical presentation is unspecific that is the reason why it is so important to recognize this disease. The case presented here is about a multiple risk factor patient who developed multiple organ failure with acute heart failure, acute lung edema, encephalopathy and diminishment of urine output after been treated with a hypercaloric parenteral nutrition. Treatment with hemodynamic support, an adequate parenteral nutrition and electrolyte correction, brought to a favorable clinical outcome.
