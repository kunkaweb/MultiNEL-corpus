BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Guillain-Barre syndrome during pregnancy is considered a rare neurological complication, and there is no consensus in literature for anesthetic management for cesarean section in such patients. The objective of this paper is to report the case of a pregnant woman with Guillain-Barre syndrome undergoing cesarean section. CASE REPORT: Female patient, 22-year old, 35 weeks and 5 days of gestation, undergoing cesarean section, hospitalized, reporting decreased strength and lower limb paresthesias. Cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) analysis showed increased protein (304 mg.dL-1) without increased cellularity. The anesthetic technique used was general anesthesia induced with propofol (1.5 mg.kg-1) and maintained with 2% sevofl urane in oxygen and fentanyl (3 Âµg.kg-1). The procedure was uneventful for both mother and neonate. The patient was discharged 10 days after admission, after progressive improvement of neurological symptoms. CONCLUSION: The anesthetic technique for pregnant women with Guillain-Barre syndrome requiring cesarean section remains at the discretion of the anesthesiologist, who should be guided by the clinical conditions and comorbidities of each patient.
