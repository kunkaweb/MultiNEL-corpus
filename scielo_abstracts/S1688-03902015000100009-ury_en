Abstract Primary Cutaneous Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma, Leg-type (CBCL-LT) accounts for 4% of the primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCL). It is characterized by being aggressive, with a five-year survival rate of around 55%. Marjolin’s ulcer is a malignant neoplasms arising in an area of chronic lesions, being squamous cell carcinoma the most frequent one. The study presents the case of a 74 year old male patient who suffered from bilateral chronic venous insufficiency, carrier of a chronic ulcer with 15 years of evolution in his right leg. Since three years ago he presents two exophytic lesions on the ulcer’s bottom, with accelerated progression in the last months, Marjolin’s ulcer being the possible diagnosis. Histopathology showed an diffuse proliferation of atypical lymphoid cells of blastic type lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemistry evidenced CD20+, CD10-, MUM1+, Bcl-2+, Bcl-6-, Ki67 90%. Studies were compatible with a diagnosis of primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma, Leg-type. Imagenology assessment failed to evidence deep adenopahties or visceromegally. Bone marrow biopsy could not be completed due to difficulties resulting from the patient’s obesity and pain intolerance. Local radiation therapy was used with a total dose of 54Gy, evolution being excellent and tumor lesions disappeared. Chemotherapy associated to rituximab is the first line therapy for primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma, leg-type, with or without radiation therapy. If the patient’s condition is not compatible with aggressive treatment, then rituximab monotherapy or radiation therapy are considered. This study corresponds to the second case of primary cutaneous lymphoma reported in the global literature, that debuts as Marjolin´s ulcer on a chronic venous lesion, and the first one of the primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg- type sub-type.
