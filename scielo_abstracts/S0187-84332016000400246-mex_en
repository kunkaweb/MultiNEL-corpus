Abstract: Chest trauma is a complex disease whose range of flail chest carries an increased mortality associated with other injuries. It is typically managed conservatively, with internal pneumatic stabilization; however, this is associated with prolonged ventilation and increased respiratory infections, in addition to tracheal stenosis. An alternative is an early surgical reconstruction by rib fracture fixation, which decreases the mechanical ventilation time and in-hospital stay. We report the case of a male patient of the 8th decade of life who presented with flail chest secondary to chest trauma and was successfully managed with surgical rib fixation, allowing early weaning from mechanical ventilation, shorter in-hospital stay, faster recovery and hospital discharge.
