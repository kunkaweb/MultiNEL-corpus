Abstract: Cytomegalovirus encephalitis (CMV) is an uncommon disease in inmunocompetent patients; not so in those with compromise of immunity as patientswith AIDS, especiallywithcounts of CD4 + T cells<50/mm3. CMVencephalitis is a serious and potentiallyfatal manifestation, giventhebroadclinicalspectrumwithwhichitmanifests and thehighindex of suspicionrequiredforits diagnosis. Theimagingstudies are guidingbutnotspecific,beingthe molecular studyby PCR incerebrospinal fluid whichallowsto establish the diagnosis of certainty. Thetreatmentisbasedonganciclovir and foscarnet associated antiretroviral therapy. We present three clinical cases with heterogeneous presentations, severe immune compromise; and where the diagnostic suspicion was fundamental to establish the specific treatment
