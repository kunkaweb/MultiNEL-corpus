Abstract: Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial glands and/or stroma outside the uterine cavity. It affects women of childbearing age, and its etiology is unknown, although a genetic component is recognized. Appendiceal endometriosis is an unusual condition which presents as chronic or recurrent abdominal pain. We present the case of a patient who consulted for abdominal pain in the right iliac fossa. Exploratory laparoscopy and appendectomy were performed, the histological analysis of which reported appendiceal endometriosis.
