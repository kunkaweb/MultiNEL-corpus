 Abstract:  Introduction:  Meckel´s diverticulum is a congenital malformation in the gastrointestinal tract. It is found in 1% of the general population. Prevalence is higher in men. Meckel´s diverticulum may be asymptomatic and be found during a surgery, as is the case in around 80% of patients.  Clinical case: twenty five year old patient, male, clinical case compatible with acute appendicitis. Upon a laparotomy, Meckel’s diverticulum is the main finding. The study aims to present a case of Meckel’s diverticulum, the clinical presentation of which appeared to be acute appendicitis, and to present the most relevant aspects of this condition.
