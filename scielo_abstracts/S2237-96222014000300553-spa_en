To enable the future establishment of a National Survey of Populations Exposed to Chemical Substances, apilot study was conducted to assess the feasibility, to test and adjust methodologies, and to establish partnerships. Three cross-sectional studies were performed: with blood donors residents in the Metropolitan Region of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazilian army conscripts and schoolchildren living in the city of Rio de Janeiro, by applying a questionnaire and collecting biological material (capillary and venous blood, nail and hair) for the analysis of metals and persistent organochlorine compounds. We concluded that it is feasible to carry out a National Survey, but the strategy for obtaining the biological samples must be set for each sub-group of the population. Moreover, it is recommended to take advantage of the structures of existing services for obtaining samples to maintain the comparability and ensure their periodicity.
