ABSTRACT Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a rare fibroblast proliferation of unknown etiology, with benign, rapid clonal growth, from a superficial fascia to the subcutaneous tissue or an adjacent muscular layer. Also known as pseudosarcomatous fasciitis, this clinical syndrome is characterized as a solitary mass of hardened consistency, painless palpation and no gender preference. The definitive diagnosis is made by immunohistochemistry and surgery is the treatment of choice.
