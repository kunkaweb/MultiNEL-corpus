ABSTRACT Type II odontoid fractures with irreducible posterior displacement are uncommon, and can cause spinal cord compression, respiratory failure and even death. Treatment is usually surgical, with transoral decompression and posterior fusion or with reduction and fusion of C1-C2 by the transoral approach. We describe a case of type II odontoid fracture with irreducible posterior atlantoaxial dislocation that was treated exclusively by the transoral approach with osteosynthesis of the odontoid, thus preserving functional segmental mobility. Level of Evidence III; therapeutic study.
