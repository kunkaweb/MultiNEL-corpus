Congestive heart failure is a pathology that limits the patient's physical function. This study analyzed one patient who was submitted to a cardiac rehabilitation program associated to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), by assessing the results of the six-minute walk test (6MWT) and a questionnaire on the quality of life and performing an echocardiographic assessment before the study and after six weeks. The distance walked by the patient increased from 152.5 m to 520.44 m at the 6MWT. The Minnesota questionnaire score decreased from 62 to 18. Ejection fraction increased from 33% to 36%. Therefore, the management chosen for this case improved the patient's physical performance and quality of life.
