Introduction. Heart transplantation (HT) is the technique of choice for individuals with severe heart failure (HF). Among the complications related to surgery the stroke is a condition that makes the post-transplant rehabilitation process more delicate. Report case. A 38-year-old volunteer with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke after HT surgery. She was submitted to a cardiac rehabilitation program (CRP) for eight weeks, consisting of protocol containing three exercises phases with varied activities. Muscle strength test, exercise capacity, functional mobility and questionnaires were applied to evaluate the outcome variables. Results. There was an increase in the isometric muscle strength of the knee flexors and extensors. There was a reduction in time to perform Timed Up and Go test. And an improve of the functional capacity. A linear correlation between systolic blood pressure and rehabilitation time was observed. In the WHOQOL-Bref quality of life questionnaire, the volunteer presented a gain in almost all domains. In WHODAS 2.0 there was an improvement in functionality. Conclusion. A specific 8-week protocol aimed at the rehabilitation of a volunteer with sequelae of stroke after CT was of great importance for improvement of exercise capacity, mobility, functionality and improvement in quality of life.
