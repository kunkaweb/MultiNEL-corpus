BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Water intoxication and electrolyte disturbances that produce systemic toxicity can be developed during transurethral prostatic resection procedures and hysteroscopic surgery. Usual causes are considered the fluid load and the duration of the operation. CASE REPORT: We present an unusual case of water intoxication in a 42 years old, female patient who underwent endoscopic resection of uterine submucuous myoma. The diagnosis and treatment is also described. CONCLUSIONS: Water intoxication may develop as a result of distending fluid overload, therefore careful fluid measurement and monitoring is crucial.
