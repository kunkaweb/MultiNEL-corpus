OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of patients with multiple sclerosis starting at or before the age of 16 in the coastal region of the state of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. CASES DESCRIPTION: Retrospective analysis of the characteristics of patients who presented the initial episode of multiple sclerosis at or before the age of 16. There were nine girls and four boys in this situation (7.1% of the total population with multiple sclerosis in such area). The average age at diagnosis was 13.9 years old (ranging from 8 to 16), and the current average age is 19.5 years old (12 to 28). The initial presentation was: ataxia (four cases), optic neuritis (two), cortical motor (two), cortical sensitive (two), dystonia (two), and spinal cord multiple sclerosis (one). All patients started with the relapsing-remitting form of the disease, and two of them now present a secondary progressive course. COMMENTS: Multiple sclerosis with onset at or before the age of 16 needs to be properly registered and discussed among pediatricians, neurologists, and neuropediatricians. Very few doctors have good knowledge about this condition, and delay in diagnosing and treating may have devastating consequences for the future of these children and adolescents.
