ABSTRACT The objective of the present study was to report the concomitance of cysticercosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Aids) in autopsied patients at a school hospital in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Cysticercosis can be seen in patients with Aids, who may or may not present symptoms according to their immunological state. Therefore, it is necessary that cysticercosis be included in the list of opportunistic infections, and that more studies be carried out for a better understanding of this coinfection.
