The tetralogy of Fallot is the most frequent cyanotic congenital heart disease in adult. Absent pulmonary valve syndrome is a rare variant, representing 3% to 6% of patients with tetralogy of Fallot. We present the case of a 29-year-old male patient with tetralogy of Fallot and absent pulmonary valve syndrome, physical examination findings and major complementary examinations; as well as its evolution and a review of the literature.
