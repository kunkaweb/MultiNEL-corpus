Subacute rupture of the free wall of the left ventricle is an infrequent complication of myocardial infarction; the incidence is considerably diminished in the last few years due to reperfusion therapies. We report the case of a male patient aged 65 years was admitted to our hospital, derived from another medical center, with presumptive diagnosis of cardiac tamponade in the course of an infero-posterolateral infarction without reperfusion therapy. Clinical presentation, risk factors, methods of diagnosis and surgical management are discussed.
