Abstract: Burns are a major public health problem and the most devastating form of trauma. Advances in burn care therapy have allowed patients with major thermal burns to survive longer, making fungal infections an increased likelihood. Fungi cause burn wound infection as part of monomicrobial or polymicrobial infections, fungemia, aggressive soft-tissue infections or opportunistic ones. Fusarium species are ubiquitous fungi and important pathogens recognized as agents of human mycotic infections. Frequently, superficial, deep-tissue involvement, and dissemination occur in immunocompromised hosts, specially burned patients. The aim of this paper is to describe the clinical, epidemiological features and outcomes of four burned patients who developed infection by Fusarium spp.
