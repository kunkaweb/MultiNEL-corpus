Abstract Patients who underwent splenectomy have an increased risk of suffering invasive infections due to capsular microorganisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The combination of pneumonia, meningitis and endocarditis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae constitute an unusual clinical condition currently known as Austrian syndrome. Both conditions are extremely serious and account for high mortality rates. Early diagnosis and immediate initiation of intensive and multidisciplinary treatment are key elements for the patients' prognosis. The study presents a case of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in a patient with splenectomy, discussing the most important aspects in terms of prevention and treatment of this clinical conditions.
