The chronic constrictive pericarditis (CP) is an uncommon, disabling and potentially fatal disease but whose diagnosis is a challenge for physicians. Diagnosis is based on the existence of hemodynamic compromise, pathophysiology constriction and, in most cases, a thickened pericardium and often also calcified. Echocardiography is the technique of choice and the most used in the initial evaluation of patients with suspected pericardial disease, because, mainly, to determine many parameters those demonstrate the constrictive pathophysiology. Pericardiectomy is the treatment of choice for chronic CP with persistent clinical, with very good prognosis if performed early. We report the case of a man of 72 years in which, as often happens, the diagnosis and treatment of CP was reached after numerous visits and examinations and in an advanced stage of the disease.
