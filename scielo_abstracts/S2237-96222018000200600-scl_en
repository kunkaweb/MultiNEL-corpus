Results: vaccination coverage against measles reached 96.7% in Ceará; of the 21 Regional Health Offices in the State, four did not reach minimum coverage of 95% for the first dose, and two for the second dose; 836 children (1.6%) were not vaccinated and 1,388 vaccine doses were not used.  Conclusion: Measles vaccination campaigns enabled the immunization coverage goal in the State of Ceará to be surpassed, despite the considerable number of unvaccinated children found.
