This is an experience report concerning the establishment of a research group through the participatory and emancipating methodology of workshopping. It was conceived within a feminist epistemology. Such an option provides the effective possibility of building a product that is shared and recognized as belonging to all the participants, among other attributes. Structuring axes were defined, around which the content and activities were developed. The results show that despite the diversity of world perceptions and experiences, of personal and institutional difficulties, the participants had a fairly positive perspective in relation to creating a research group to improve and disseminate gender knowledge on women's health. The workshop enabled the participants to enjoy a pleasant and gentle environment and yet be very committed to an innovative way of making science.
