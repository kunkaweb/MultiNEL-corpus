The goal of this article is to present four models of shift report, which had been implemented over the years on inpatient medical-surgical units in a private hospital in SÃ£o Paulo City, Brazil. The article highlights the negative and positive points or each model. The discussion of these points is based on information from literature and the clinical experience of the authors. Strategies adopted by each model are also discussed such as the ways to minimize overtime, duration of shift report, and differences in understanding the information. The strategies point out the necessity of integration between the shift report and the existing model, the type of shift and the distribution of services, and the quality of the handbook notes. Whichever model of shift report is adopted, the commitment and qualification of the professionals are fundamental for the achievement of positive results.
