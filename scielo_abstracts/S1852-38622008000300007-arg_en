Revascularization in coronary artery disease should be based on clinical data, evidence of inducible ischemia, left ventricular function and coronary anatomy; however in patients with history of extended acute myocardial infarction and severe left ventricular dysfunction in whom no residual ischemia has been demonstrated, myocardial viability acquires great clinical relevance because itÂ´s presence will indicate us if it is necessary and beneficial the revascularization. Myocardial viability will allow us to predict with great accuracy the recovery of the dysfunctional myocardium, like the improvement of survival and the quality of the patients life after the revascularization. Inside the area of nuclear cardiology, the most sensitive study for detection of viable myocardium is the Positron Emission Tomography with Fluorine 18 Deoxi-glucose.
