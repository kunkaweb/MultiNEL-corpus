Summary Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the main cause of maternal morbimortality, followed by hemorrhage. The thromboembolic disease accounts for 19.6 % of obstetric deaths. The study presents the clinical case of a 29 year old patient with a bad obstetric history, who, pregnant with her fourth child evidenced bilateral pulmonary embolism and subsequently lost her pregnancy. The cause of death could not be attributed to any of the thromboembolisms known until today, in spite of the high incidence (50%) of thromboembolic diseases in the pregnant population with venous thromboembolism.
