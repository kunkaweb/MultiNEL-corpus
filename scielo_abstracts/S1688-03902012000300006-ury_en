Summary Introduction: Abdominal tuberculosis is an unusual condition with a proteiform presentation and rather difficult a diagnosis. Its frequency has risen due to the appearance of HIV infection, resistance to anti-tuberculosis drug resistance and changes in migration. Method: The study presents the clinical case of a 63 year old female patient who consulted for a 10 day right flank and hypochondrium pain. The patient subsequently developed distended abdomen, temperature and ascites. Gynecological ultrasound, CT and tumor markers led us to consider malignant ovarian pathology and thus diagnostic laparoscopy was performed with a intraoperative biopsy, what results in abdominal tuberculosis being diagnosed. We conducted a bibliographical review of abdominal tuberculosis. Conclusion: abdominal tuberculosis, in spite of its being a severe condition that may result in serious complications, evidences a positive response to medical treatment and both functional and vital prognosis are good.
