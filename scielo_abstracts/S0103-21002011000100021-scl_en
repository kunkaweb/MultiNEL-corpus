The objective of this study was to discuss the complexity of preparing the monthly nursing schedule during the Nursing Administration course, in an inpatient unit of a public teaching hospital, in SÃ£o Paulo. We started from the position that the preparation of a monthly schedule consisted of a series of coordinated actions which required: recognition of staff, collection of data needed to characterize the clinical reality, comparison of those data with the literature, and development of a proposal for action, which we would discuss with the nurses in the unit. This experience provided the possibility to reflect on empowerment and the understanding of these professionals about the factors involved in the implementation of this management activity. It allowed us, as well, to demonstrate the importance of diagnosing the needs of the unit and comparing it with the institutional reality, with a view toward possible actions to resolve the identified problems
