Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) results from gene mutation that causes defective or insuffi cient collagen formation. It may cause various anesthetic complications due to the diffi culty in airway management, existence of spinal deformity, respiratory disorders, cardiac anomalies, thrombocyte function disorder, risk of hyperthermia, bacillary invagination, bone deformities and metabolic disorders. The anesthesia management of OI patients should be exercised with caution given certain risks of respiratory disorders. These risks are due to thorax deformity, bone fractures during moving or changing position, mandibular and cervical fractures related with intubation, diffi cult intubation and malignant hyperthermia. The anesthetic technique using Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) and laryngeal mask airway is suitable for pediatric patient care with OI. However, these techniques have not yet been reported as useful in neurosurgery case reports. In this study, we present the use of TIVA and ProSeal Laringeal Mask in a child with OI and epidural hemorrhage. We came to the conclusion that LMA and TIVA can safely be used in the anesthetic management of OI patients with severe anesthetic problems.
