We report the case of a 29-year-old man, victim of a car accident, who suffered a severe blunt chest trauma, with evolving congestive heart failure. He had previously had a good overall health status, with no symptoms of cardiovascular disease. At the initial assessment, the electrocardiogram showed Q waves in the precordial leads and the echocardiogram disclosed severe left ventricular dysfunction. Coronary angiogram showed a proximal left anterior descending coronary artery lesion, with anterior wall akinesis on contrast-enhanced ventriculography. A Thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed no viability. He remained on medical treatment with good evolution.
