We present four cases of children who are treated at the Infectious Disease ward of the Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell presenting with skin and soft tissues infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus which were reported as methycilin-resistant community acquired. In none of the cases could we detect any risk factor associated with the finding of this infectious agent. The importance of performing a careful antibiotic sensibility study for staphylococcus aureus is underscored as this will allow a better therapy of these infections.
