BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Reporting two cases of anesthesia in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients, which is an uncommon, progressive and disabling disease, and discussing anesthetic approaches, impairment of pulmonary and cardiac functions, the possibility of malignant hyperthermia, increased sensitivity to neuromuscular blockers and increased postoperative morbidity are some challenges faced by anesthesiologists. CASE REPORTS: First case was a pediatric patient with DMD and rhabdomyosarcoma, scheduled for tumor excision and cervical emptying. During preanesthetic evaluation, history, clinical and additional exams, no changes were detected except for the cervical tumor. We decided for total intravenous anesthesia with remifentanil administered by continuous infusion and propofol by target-controlled infusion without neuromuscular blockers. Surgery lasted 180 minutes without intercurrences. The second case was a male patient, 24 years old, with DMD and cholelithiasis with surgical indication who, during preoperative evaluation, has revealed severe restrictive pneumopathy with decreased capacity and respiratory reserves and the need for nasal BIPAP at night. For this patient we decided for tracheal intubation with minimum sedation and topic anesthesia, followed by total intravenous anesthesia with remifentanil administered by continuous infusion and propofol by target-controlled infusion without neuromuscular blockers. At the end, patient was extubated still in to operating room and nasal BIPAP was immediately placed, being patient referred to the ICU. Patient was discharged from ICU in the 2nd PO day and from hospital in the 3rd PO day. CONCLUSIONS: Total intravenous anesthesia with propofol and remifentanil administered by continuous infusion without neuromuscular blockers is a safe and effective option for DMD patients.
