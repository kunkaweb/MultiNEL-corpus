Abstract  Objective:  to describe a simplified protocol to diagnose suspected cases of meningitis.  Methods:  this is an experience report on the approach to diagnosing meningitis at the Tropical Diseases Reference Service in the state of Piau√≠, Brazil, between 2007 and 2016; information was extracted from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) and the laboratory record book; the chi-square test was used to compare epidemiological surveillance indicators based on final meningitis case classification; the Phi coefficient was used to verify the correlation between presumed diagnosis and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis.  Results:  considering the 4,096 cases of meningitis investigated, there was a reduction in the generic classification of meningitis cases from 72% to 47% (p<0.001); indicated laboratory investigation profile showed agreement with final meningitis case diagnosis. (rf=0.66; p<0.001).  Conclusion:  a greater proportion of specific etiologic diagnosis of meningitis was achieved while the protocol was in use.
