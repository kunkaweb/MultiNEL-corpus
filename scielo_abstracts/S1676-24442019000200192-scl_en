ABSTRACT Peripheral odontogenic fibroma (POF) is a rare benign neoplasm of odontogenic mesenchymal origin that accounts for approximately 4.7% of all odontogenic tumors. This article reports the case of a 29-year-old woman who presented with a painless, reddish mass in the right vestibular mandibular gingiva between the second premolar and the first molar. Radiographic examination revealed small crestal bone loss in the region. Microscopic analysis revealed a tumor composed of cellular fibroblastic connective tissue intermingled with conspicuous islands and strands of apparently inactive odontogenic epithelium. The final diagnosis was POF. No clinical signs of recurrence were observed 22 months after surgical excision. POF may be clinically mistaken for other common gingival lesions, such as pyogenic granuloma, peripheral giant cell lesion, and peripheral ossifying fibroma. Conservative local excision has been suggested as the treatment of choice for POF. However, in view of the paucity of information on the biological behavior and recurrence rate of this tumor, long-term follow-up of patients is mandatory.
