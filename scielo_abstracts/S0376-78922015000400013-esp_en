Lymphedema is defined by interstitial retention of hyperproteic fluid. In an early stage it is reversible; however, in more advanced stages it triggers multiple local reactions ending with the enlargement of the extremities by hypertrophy and fibrosis of the superficial soft tissues. Surgical treatment of chronic secondary lymphedema is identical no matter the etiology. Nevertheless, it depends on the grade of the disease. In early stages, the conservative treatment is the first option, but if this is not effective, the microsurgical procedures with the establishment of lymphatical-venous and lympho-lynfatics anastomosis are accepted as state of the art, with excellent results. At a further stage, radical excision techniques, specifically Charles procedure, represent a satisfatory option in the final resolution of the problem, attending the need of volumetric reduction. With this case report, the authors seek to demonstrate the value of Charles procedure in the treatment of chronic secondary lymphedema of the dorsum of the foot.
