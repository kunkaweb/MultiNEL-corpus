Endovascular stent grafting is applied for the treatment of different aortic pathologies in the current medical era. It may be lifesaving in patients with comorbidities and virtually inoperable when adopting conventional techniques. This manuscript reports on a 40-year-old patient, who was previously treated for a mycotic saccular aneurysm at the aortic arch and who presented with a descending aortic rupture at the mid-term follow-up. The descending aortic rupture was also managed successfully by endovascular measures.
