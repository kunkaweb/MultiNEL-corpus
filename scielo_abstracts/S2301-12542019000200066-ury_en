Abstract: Hip dislocation of the anterior-obturator type is an unusual pathology in pediatric orthopedics, but with potentially serious complications in evolution. By the way, we present the case of a 14-year-old girl who suffered a secondary anterior-obturator dislocation and high-energy trauma. A closed reduction was made in the surgical block under general anesthesia, with good evolution and without complications in a follow-up of 24 months.
