Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy, a not so benign entity About a case Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy is known as a benign and reversible entity. Its typical presentation is characterized by transient, apical systolic dysfunction and a hypercontractile base of the left ventricle, in the absence of coronary occlusion, frequently occurring in older women after a stressful situation. Since it usually simulates an acute coronary syndrome, the differential diagnosis is essential for its treatment. Recently, it was reported that serious intrahospital complications are found in the same proportion as acute coronary syndrome. In this case, there is an older woman, symptomatic of dyspnea functional class IV, supra-level of the ST segment on the anterior side, with elevation of troponin, coronary arteries without significant lesions in the coronary angiography and evidence of images compatible with Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy in the transthoracic echocardiogram, complicated during his hospitalization with cardiogenic shock and cardiac tamponade.
