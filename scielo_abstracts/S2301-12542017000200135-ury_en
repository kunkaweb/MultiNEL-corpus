Abstract: Anti-tumor necrosis factor alfa drugs are responsible for blocking one of the cytoquines implicated on inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis. Its use has been linked to an increase in tuberculosis cases which is why screening before starting treatment is mandatory. Latent tuberculosis is treated with isoniazid as chemoprophylaxis although its use may provoke adverse effects. A case is presented of a patient with skin adverse reaction due to the use of isoniazid.
