Objective: evaluating the perinatal results of isoimmunised pregnancies submitted to intrauterine foetal transfusion at the Fernandes Figueira Institute (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Patients and methods: this was a retrospective descriptive review of the charts of isoimmunised pregnant women submitted to intrauterine foetal transfusion from 1996 to 2006. Perinatal history, antenatal assistance at the index pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were assessed. Results: 316 intra-uterine transfusions were given to 85 pregnant women (to correct foetal anaemia), 90pregnanciesand94foetuses(4twinpregnancies). All 90 pregnancies had the anti-Rh(D) antibody. Twelve foetuses (12.8%) were hydropic at the first intrauterine transfusion and 5 (5.3%) presented ascitis. Survival rate was 89.4%, with 4 foetal deaths and 6 neonatal deaths. However, perinatal survival was 92.2% for non-hydropic foetuses and 76.5% for hydropic ones. Conclusions: these results confirmed the safetyand efficacy of intrauterine transfusion when treating immune haemolytic anaemia if these procedures are performed in reference units for perinatal assistance when high-risk conditions are involved.
