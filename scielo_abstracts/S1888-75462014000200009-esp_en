The Wolff-Parkinson White syndrome (WPW) can be detected in asymptomatic athletes when we perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) or may be submitted with episodes of palpitations secondary to arrhythmias. We report the case of a basketball player with previous normal examination, whom pre-excitation pattern is detected, in a sport medical evaluation. The patient is occasionally symptomatic. After appropriate studies, the ablation treatment was indicated. In its evolution after the procedure, the patient still has symptoms and in the electrocardiogram the accessory pathway reappears. The aim of this paper is to analyze the diagnosis, adequate treatment and follow of this disease in an adolescent athlete.
