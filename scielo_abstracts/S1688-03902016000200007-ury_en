Abstract Hemorrhagic complications in oral anticoagulant therapy are frequent. Spontaneous sublingual hematomas secondary to anticoagulants are an extremely unusual complication that is potentially lethal. The study reports a case of a patient on anticoagulation therapy with warfarine who develops a massive, spontaneous sublingual hematoma with obstruction of the high airway and cardiac arrest, where emergency transtracheal catheter ventilation was used.
