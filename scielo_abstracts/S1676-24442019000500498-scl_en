ABSTRACT Carcinoma cuniculatum (CC), a rare variant of oral squamous cell carcinoma, presents well-differentiated neoplastic epithelial cells infiltrating the underlying submucosal or bone tissues, forming the so-called "rabbit burrows" filled with keratin. A 67-year-old female patient was referred complaining of a painless tumoral mass in the left mandibular body, with several months of evolution. Previous history indicated extraction of the teeth #37 and #38 and diagnosis of chronic suppurative osteomyelitis. A deep incisional biopsy revealed CC. Due to its microscopic features, suggesting an inflammatory or reactive process, strict clinicopathological correlation is necessary for the correct diagnosis of CC.
