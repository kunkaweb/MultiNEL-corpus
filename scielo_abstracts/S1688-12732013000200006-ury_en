Introduction The satisfaction of the patient in labor analgesia is one of the most important objectives that we pursue and is also a measure of outcome and quality. Factors associated with maternal satisfaction are still unknown. Objectives Our goal is to measure the satisfaction of patients associated with labor analgesia and study the demographic characteristics of our obstetric population. Methods We performed a prospective descriptive study cover maternity cases, through a survey to each patient. Maternal satisfaction was measured in a qualitative way and at the beginning and after analgesia pain using the visual analog scale to measure the effectiveness of it. Results A total of 151 surveys were collected. Of these 151 patients, a very high percentage were satisfied and calm, 98.01% would recommend the technique and 93.37% would apply at a future childbirth. Conclusions Maternal satisfaction is strongly determined by the effectiveness of the technique (pain relief), depending not only of this but also of other factors such as the support received during the labor and previous experiences.
