This study aims to analyze the work processes developed in a Family Health Unit. It is a Case Study, a qualitative survey which used as its empirical material a field-log supervised internship report and participant observation. Hence, it pinpoints the potentialities of educational and cultural activities carried out by the unit. Its limits relate to shortcomings in the workers' formation, in the under-use of information on primary healthcare tools and in its control-based management. The study concludes pointing out the need for revising labor organization based on an analysis of ongoing labor processes. Moreover, changes are needed in the health workers' formation, chiefly preparing them for using popular-education tools and for fostering accountability, bonds, and autonomy.
