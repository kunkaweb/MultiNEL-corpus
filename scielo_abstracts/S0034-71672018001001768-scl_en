ABSTRACT  Objective: to build municipal responsibility with the permanent education in health policy from the interaction between research and innovation of work practices.  Method: experience reports structured through dialogic meetings that allowed the participative diagnosis and strategic administration considering research in health education.  Results: from the activities and interactions, we identified active forces in the reinvention of training for workers in the municipal network of health services, in which we found three streams: “inside and outside interactions”, “movement towards meetings” and “strategic collective arrangements”.  Final considerations: through action research and a collaborative critique, collective movements were constructed, they showed ways to produce new directions in health education and allowed the strategic creation of the Núcleo de Educação Permanente as a responsibility of the municipal government, not depending on Federal policies.
