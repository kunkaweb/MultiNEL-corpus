SUMMARY Transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome , also known as takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a reversible acute cardiac failure described for the first time for Japanese population at 1990, being reports linked to perioperative period each time more frequent. The left ventricle’s shape at ventriculography resembles a classic Japanese vessel used to catch octopuses called “takotsubo”, from which the name of this picture comes from. We report a case of a female 57 years old patient ,scheduled for a lumbar spinal fusion. After anesthesia induction endotraqueal intubation was impossible and ventilation was difficult under laryngeal mask. Hipoxemia, tachycardia and arterial hypertension were observed. Regurgitation of gastric contents and aspiration were confirmed. The patient installed an hemodynamic instability with arterial hipotension and then acute pulmonary edema. Surgery was stopped and cardiovascular resuscitation was started. In the intensive care unit electrocardiogram didn´t show definite signs of ischemia, troponin levels were positive and echocardiogram showed extensive left ventricular anteroseptal and apicolateral akinesia with severe decrease of LVEF to 38%. On the third day the patient had an episode of angina pectoris. The coronary angiography dismissed significant coronary artery lesions. Another echocardiogram showed apical akinesia type Takotsubo without interventricular gradients and LVEF 26%. The patient improved and she was discharged on the tenth day.
