SUMMARY Acute esophageal necrosis, or black esophagus, is a rare syndrome affecting sick elderly patients, with high mortality rate. Its clinical expression is gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment includes hemodynamic support, nil-per-os, proton pump inhibitors and management of the coexisting clinical conditions. We report the case of a woman presenting with black esophagus as complication of a percutaneous gastrostomy, who received medical care at Hospital Pablo Tobón Uribe, in Medellín, Colombia.
