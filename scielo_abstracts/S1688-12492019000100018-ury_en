Summary: In the era of minimally invasive ventilatory procedures, the prophylactic administration of surfactant using simple techniques that can be performed in low complexity settings, should be researched as a tool to potentially reduce preterm morbidity and mortality. We report the use of oropharyngeal surfactant in 4 very low birth weight newborns (average birth weight 1236g and 28 weeks of gestational age) and of continuous positive airway pressure before the first intrauterine inspiration and keeping an intact umbilical cord. No adverse effects happened, and the aspiration of gastric residual confirmed that surfactant had reached the lungs. The administration of oropharyngeal surfactant is an innovative, safe, feasible and reproducible technique. It minimizes the risks of possible iatrogenesis due to the technique used, and it also facilitates a more stable cardiovascular transition, maintaining the fetusâ€™ placental circulation.
