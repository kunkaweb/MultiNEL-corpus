Adrenergic cardiomyopathy or tako-tsubo syndrome or transient apical dyskinesia or apical ballooning is characterized by excessive sympathetic stimulation, which induces coronary vasospasm, all of a transient nature with recovery of contractility to normality in the weeks after the event. We present the case of a 37-year-old female patient presenting with acute coronary syndrome, electrocardiograms with negative T-waves on the anterior face, elevated cardiac enzymes, severe transient apical dyskinesia, angiographically normal coronary arteries. Elevated urinary catecholamine dosage resulted in an abdominal magnetic resonance imaging that showed a left adrenal mass in the clinical setting of a pheochromocytoma.
