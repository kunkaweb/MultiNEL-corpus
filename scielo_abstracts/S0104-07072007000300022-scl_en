This study presents the School Project (Projeto Escola) and its resulting divisions as a strategy of the Brazilian National Policy for Blood and Hemoderivatives (Pol√≠tica Nacional do Sangue e Hemoderivados). The objective of this text is to publicize the School Project and its unfoldings by presenting it in consonance with this policy, which determines that 3-5% of the Brazilian population will be blood donors. This brings to the forefront the discussion of the history of hemotherapy and legislation which subsidizes this policy. This project was developed by professionals who have worked with Attracting and Receiving Donors in the Hematological and Hemotherapy Center of Santa Catarina, Brazil since 1996. A specific objective was to consciously attract responsible and healthy donors, seeking to increase the number of donors and their commitment. There are incentives offered by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, as well as programs which contribute towards greater awareness for the importance of blood donation, which have made an increased awareness possible among the population, resulting in a greater exercise of citizenship.
