BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Carbon dioxide gas embolism is an uncommon but potentially lethal complication of laparoscopic surgery. Our report aimed at describing a case of pulmonary carbon dioxide embolism with favorable evolution. CASE REPORT: Hypertensive patient was submitted to laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia due to cholelithiasis. After 150 minutes of pneumoperitoneum, patient developed tachycardia with severe hemodynamic deterioration, despite the use of vasopressor drugs. Arterial blood-gas revealed major difference between PaCO2 and P ET CO2. Carbon dioxide embolism was suspected and pneumoperitoneum was immediately deflated. Surgery was converted to a conventional technique. Patient has evolved with hemodynamic improvement and was extubated at surgery completion, being referred to post-anesthetic care unit (PACU). CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and immediate treatment resulted in positive outcome in this case.
