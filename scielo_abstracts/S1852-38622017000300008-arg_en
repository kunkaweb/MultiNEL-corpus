The presence of a Valsalva sinus aneurysm is quite rare. This anatomical condition can end in the rupture and fistulization to different cardiac structures, with a possible catastrophic clinical evolution. The diagnosis of this disease can be laborious; however, an important clinical finding is the presence of a continuous murmur, which although not specific to this pathology, guides in the approach and detection of possible causes. The conjunction of clinic, echocardiographic and hemodynamic findings, through angiocardiography, is primordial in the adequate characterization of this anomaly. According to their natural history, all patients should be treated surgically.
