Abstract   OBJECTIVE   To describe the construction of the scenarios and the development of the realistic simulation technique in health on safe administration of drugs for nursing professionals.   METHOD  Report of experience developed from October 2017 to May 2018 involving the steps of training of the facilitators, construction of the scenarios, development of the realistic simulation with nursing staff of a teaching hospital in the southern region of Brazil. The best simulation practice guidelines used from the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning.   RESULTS   Four practice-based scenarios were constructed based on adverse events. The nurses educators trained the facilitators participating in all stages. There was concern about the fidelity of the scenarios, as well as the execution of the briefing and debriefing stages.   CONCLUSIONS   The simulation allowed the reflection of the "way of doing" of the teams adjusting the process of preparation and administration of medicines to the institutional recommendations and, thus, promoting the safety of the process.
