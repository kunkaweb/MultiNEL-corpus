It is a descriptive and quantitative study, conducted in 2009 with 19 women, through the application of an individual questionnaire containing questions about sexual habits and use of FP. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the FURG in opinion No. 53/2009. The results found that 47.30% reported that they check their health status regularly, 58% already had contact with this type of condom in the health service and 73.55% claim never to have acquired an STI. Regarding sexual practices 68.45% reported using condoms only to prevent STDs, women who are already using PF practised vaginal sex and 47.30% do not see the advantages and 52.65% do not see the disadvantages of using the PF.
