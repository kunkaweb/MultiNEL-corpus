SUMMARY The Tako-tsubo syndrome has low incidence and a benign evolution in great number of cases. Transient left ventricular dysfunction syndrome or Tako-tsubo syndrome occurs following intense emotional or physical stress and simulates the clinical presentation of an acute myocardial infarction , with reversible left ventricular apical ballooning in the abscense of angiographically significant coronary artery stenosis. Only a few patients can dead. It can repeat in the same patient. We report a case of a 83 year old woman, whom had a Tako-tsubo syndrome two years ago; without symptoms at the present, who underwent a hip arthroplasty with a subarachnoid blockade with farmacological sedation ( premedication with midazolam i/v and infusion of propofol during the intraoperative period). There was no clinical neither electrocardiographic changes mimicking acute myocardial infarction . The evolution was good and the patient was discharged from hospital in 72 hours
