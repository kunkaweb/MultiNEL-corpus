BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Loco-regional anesthesia for cataract extraction surgery offers as advantages minimum physiological changes, complete anesthesia, eye reflexes blockade, lower incidence of nausea and vomiting and shorter recovery time, in addition to postoperative analgesia. Continuous concern with blockade quality as well as with postoperative analgesia is responsibility of the anesthesiologist. This study aimed at evaluating whether fentanyl has contributed to blockade quality and postoperative analgesia in cataract extraction surgery with implantation of intraocular lens. METHODS: The association of fentanyl and 0.75% bupivacaine for eye blockade and postoperative analgesia was evaluated in 164 patients undergoing cataract extraction with implantation of intraocular lens (extracapsular technique). Patients were homogeneous in gender, demographics, operated eye, ASA physical status and Goldman’s cardiac risk index. Patients were randomly allocated in two groups (82 patients each): with or without fentanyl. Blockade quality was evaluated according to the following parameters: intraoperative pain; eyelid and/or eyeball movement; Bell’s reflex persistence; number of blocks needed to produce akinesia and surgeons evaluation of blockade. Postoperative analgesia was evaluated by patients’ request for additional postoperative analgesia. RESULTS: Results have shown that fentanyl has significantly improved medial rectus muscle blockade quality (with fentanyl - 17.1%; without fentanyl - 32.9%) and has decreased postoperative analgesics consumption (analgesics with fentanyl - 20.7%; no analgesics with fentanyl - 41.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In the conditions of this study, fentanyl has improved block quality, has decreased medial rectus muscle motility and the need for postoperative analgesics.
