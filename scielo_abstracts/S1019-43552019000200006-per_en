Osteomas are usually solitary, slow-growing and asymptomatics lesions. The most common sites of occurrence are condyle and jaw body. Osteomas involving condyle can cause changes in patientâ€ ™s occlusion, progressive and slow deviation of the midline, as well as increased facial volume accompanied by pain and limited mouth opening. An osteoma located in mandible border is typical of the Gardnerâ€™s Syndrome. There are many clinical features of this syndrome, which can affect the skin, endocrine system and orofacial area. About 90% of patients with this condition have skeletal abnormalities, making osteomas the most frequent lesions in the paranasal sinuses and jaws. The objective of this work is to report the clinical case of a female patient with Gardnerâ€™s Syndrome with osteoma located in the left mandibular condyle, who was submitted to resection of the lesion.
