ABSTRACT This study's aim was to describe the experience of implementing the Brazilian Network for Nursing and Patient Safety, as well activities intended to disseminate a culture of patient safety in health and educational institutions. This is an experiment report. The Brazilian Network was completed six years ago and, since its establishment, has promoted actions always in consonance with the objectives of the International Network for Nursing and Patient Safety and the World Alliance for Patient Safety. Networks proposed by the Pan American Health Organization corroborated the actions taken by the Brazilian Network. These actions have been successful, as every year new members are added and new Centers are established, while the Network has participated in academic, scientific and government activities. The challenge lies in increasing the impact of these actions to implement safe practices effectively in healthcare facilities.
