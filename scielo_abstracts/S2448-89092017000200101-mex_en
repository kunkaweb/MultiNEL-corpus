Abstract: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is characterized by asymmetric and non-dilated left ventricle hypertrophy, sudden death is probably a consequence of unpredictable myocardial electrical disturbances that produce lethal arrhythmias. Cardiomyopathies are defined by the existence of structural and functional abnormalities of the left ventricle that can not be explained by coronary disease or abnormal load conditions causing the increased thickness of the wall of the left ventricle, within this diseases group exists genetic and nongenetic causes, these are described associated drugs including the use of anabolic androgenic steroids. Anabolic androgenic steroids are used to promote increased muscle mass, to improve the performance of athletes, this has led to the use and abuse of these products in professional and recreational athletes, chronic use in supraphysiological dose in this population is attaches a several cardiovascular manifestations as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, this association between the use of anabolic androgenic steroids and cardiac hypertrophy has been shown in a study by pathological findings in ASS users deceased.1 The purpose of this communication is to report an unusual case in our hospital of a patient with chronic use of anabolic androgenic steroids and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
