We present a three year old girl with diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) in whom the existence of a concomitant infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was confirmed. During treatment she presented a hypersensitivity response to aspirin which was then switched to another antiplatelet agent. Relationship between KD and EBV infection is discussed. Hypersensitivity response is analysed.
