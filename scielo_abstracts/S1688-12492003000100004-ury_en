Summary We describe a 6 year-old child with a history of repeated respiratory infections who is seen at the Infectious Disease ward at the Centro Hospitalario Pereira Rossell presenting with a generalized dermathosis. The lesions suggest a particular form of scabies which is confirmed by a parasitologic examination. This particular presentation is known as crust or Norwegian scabies and it is known to have certain characteristics which must be kept in mind: it is highly contagious due to the very high population of acharids. It is rarely seen in patients who are previously healthy but frequent in immunocompromised or patients with neurologic disease. Treatment must be administered early and adequate in order to avoid hospital ad community spreading.
