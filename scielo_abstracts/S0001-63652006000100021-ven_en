Some years ago in the 40 and 50 decades of last century were carried out studies, because little development of the half third of the face was observed as consequence of the surgical treatment in early times of the patient’s life with cleft palate. Surgeons dentists began to use bone graft to get the anatomical integrity of the alveolar arch and this way to facilitate their development, the eruption would jag and the intermaxillary’s functions. These interventions are very bloody for the taking of the transplant in areas like the lukewarm one, rib and ilium. At the present time less bloody and aggressive techniques exist as the one that uses the platelet rich plasma in blended platelet with medullary autogenous bone. The repot of a case is made.
