Abstract: BacilleCalmette-Gu√©rinintravesical instillation (BCG) is the main treatment for superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. In spite of it being a safe procedure, severe complications as granulomatous hepatitis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome occur in a few patients. The study presents the case of a patient with a diagnosis of superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (T1), who died as a consequence of a severe systemic compromise of the central nervous system, secondary to instravesical instillation of BCG.
