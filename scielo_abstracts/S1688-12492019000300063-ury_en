Summary:  Introduction: a cervical rib is an uncommon malformation, that may lead to different diagnoses and to variable and controversial treatment procedures.   Objectives: to describe a cervical rib case, to analyze how it was treated and to review the relevant bibliography.   Clinical observation:  healthy 7-year-old male, on whom a supraclavicular tumor was found during a check-up. He was studied until an asymptomatic bilateral cervical rib diagnosis was reached. We have followed-up the case closely and ten months after the finding the patient remains asymptomatic.   Discussion and literature review:  we have identified clinical elements that may lead to this diagnosis and may speed up the course of action to adopt as well as generate less patient discomfort, less family anxiety and lower system costs. Literature suggests that once the patient and his family have been warned about the symptoms that could require a rapid consultation, most cases can be treated as expected. We also described to them rare indications, available options and controversial issues that may arise.
