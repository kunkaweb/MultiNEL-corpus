BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Scleroderma or progressive systemic sclerosis is a systemic connective tissue disease of unknown origin, which normally courses with microangiopathy, extremities ischemia and severe pain. This report aimed at describing a case of intravenous lidocaine to treat ischemic pain and at emphasizing potential anti-inflammatory action of local anesthetics in scleroderma patients. CASE REPORT: Female patient, clear mulatto 34 years old, nursing assistant, with scleroderma for approximately 8 years, presented with severe continuous, daily pain (numeric scale = 10) in upper and lower limbs, followed by trophic, color and temperature changes, and small ulcers on extremities. Patient was submitted to 1 weekly session of intravenous 2% lidocaine (400 mg) without vasoconstrictor for 10 weeks with pain, turgor, skin elasticity and peripheral perfusion improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Pain and other symptoms relief after intravenous lidocaine suggests that local anesthetics are able to modulate inflammatory response in different scleroderma stages.
