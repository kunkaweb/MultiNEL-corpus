This study is a report on care practice. Its objective was to develop a proposal for education in health care from a group of people with tuberculosis, seeking to increase the effectiveness of their treatment. The data was obtained through a proposal for education in health care, developed through a living group. Two interrelated themes resulted from the process of analyzing the data: the perception of tuberculosis and its care and treatment, and social isolation. These represent the elements that influence education in health care for people with tuberculosis, as well as the meaning that such a situation has to these people.
