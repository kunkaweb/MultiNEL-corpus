We report a dual-source computed tomography study of dynamic and quantitative myocardial perfusion in a 44-year-old patient with previous documented coronary artery disease. Quantitatively, the tomography showed myocardial perfusion deficit in the territories with significant coronary stenosis, confirmed by computed tomography angiography and conventional angiography. Dual-source computed tomography allowed dynamic perfusion and anatomic evaluation in a single study during the follow-up of this patient.
