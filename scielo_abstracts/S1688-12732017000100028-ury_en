Abstract: Mediastinal masses are infrequent; they consist of a heterogeneous group of tumors that represent 3% of all thoracic surgeries performed in children (benign 75%, malignant 25%). They can be found in the mediastinum anterior middle or posterior, and the symptoms seem to depend on their location, rather than the size or tumor strain. Anterior mediastinal tumors are a challenge for anesthesiologists, because of their relationship with anatomical structures and the risk of collapse of the cardiorespiratory system. The objective of this article is to present a clinical case of a girl with an anterior mediastinal mass and to expose the anesthesiological management of the perioperative process. An emphasis is placed on the most relevant concepts regarding: clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, and anesthetic implications, and on preoperative treatment, intraoperative anesthetic management, and possible complications.
