Introduction: epitheloid hemangiothelioma is a mesenchymal tumour of unknown etiology and typically disseminated for diagnosis. Until today, 400 cases have been described around the world. Method: the case of a young woman who consulted for pain in the right hypochondrium is presented. She presented tumoral hepatomegaly and splenomegaly that were imagenologically confirmed, and costal and vertebral lytic lesion. Hepatic biopsy shows high-grade epitheloid hemangiothelioma. A bibliographic review of the conditions is conducted, in particular regarding its hepatic presentation. Results: radiotherapy to the spine for pain was initiated and the patient presented a rapid deterioration of her general condition and died as a result of sepsis of respiratory origin. Conclusion: epitheloid hemangiothelioma must be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients seen for hepatic tumors, and surgery is the best choice of treatment.
