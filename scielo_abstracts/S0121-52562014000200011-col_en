Pemphigus foliaceus and vulgaris are autoimmune diseases characterized by blisters that break easily leaving behind superficial erosions, with different locations in the epidermis depending on the immunologic profile with which they present. We report the case of a patient with simultaneous presentation of pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, an association of low incidence with few cases reported in the literature.
