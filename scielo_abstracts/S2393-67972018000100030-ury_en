ABSTRACT:   Introduction:   Regardless of their etiology, chronic wounds, represent a therapeutic challenge because they are often refractory to conventional treatments. Due to this observation, in the last few years, new complementary strategies have emerged in the area of regenerative medicine, including stem cell therapeutics, tissue engineering, platelet rich plasma, and growth factors applied to chronic wounds. These complementary therapies have shown certain benefits in healing of complex wounds.   Materials and methods :  We present two clinical cases of patients with chronic wounds of different etiology, refractory to advanced and conventional wound treatments, which received complementary granulocyte colony-stimulating growth factor (G-CSF; FilgenÂ®). Local injections with G-CSF were administered weekly in periulcer skin at a dose of 300 mcg/ml, completing two series of four injections each.   Results: Both cases showeda reduction in their areas, reaching to total healing inone patient, and a reduction of 37% in the other one after two series of treatment. The procedure was well tolerated and no adverse effects were detected.   Conclusions: The results obtained with these patients showed a benefit in cicatrization with the administration of G-CSF. Controlled clinical trials are needed to establish the role of G-CSF in these wounds. Thus, our group is developing a protocol to evaluate this aspect.
