Abstract: Soft tissue metastases are rare but not exceptional. The primitive tumor that most frequently produces them is lung cancer. The most relevant differential diagnosis is sarcoma which has a very similar clinical and imaging presentation, requiring in most cases of histology and inmunohistochemistry to distinguish between them. In this article we describe a complex case of a 46 year old male patient, smoker, who had a pleural effusion and a soft tissue mass as the first manifestations of a lung adenocarcinoma.
