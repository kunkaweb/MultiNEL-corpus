Introduction: Leptospirosis is an acute febrile disease caused by the leptospira. It is considered a zoonosis that affects a variety of animals, both wild and domestic (mainly rodents). Humans become infected accidentally by contact with urine or tissues from infected animals. This pathology has variable clinical manifestations, ranging from inapparent infections and aseptic meningitis, to severe forms such as the Weil syndrome. Development: We present the case of a young patient of 22 years old with fever quantified peaks of 40Â° C, chills, profuse sweating, headache, muscle and joint pain in knees and malleoli , retroorbital and retrosternal pain; and appetite loss. The symptoms occurred after 20 days of having practiced extreme water sports. Conclusion: The late diagnosis of the patient and hospital readmission are the result of several factors; First, the homology with other infectious diseases that present acute febrile illness with similar symptoms as dengue, malaria, influenza, yellow fever, brucellosis; and secondly the lack of expertise and poor contact with patients who present this disease by the medical staff. Correct antibiotic treatment and proper support reduce morbidity and mortality. The objective of this article is to describe a case of human leptospirosis and make a review of the literature in order to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and relevant clinical manifestations.
