Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of death and disability affecting more than 5 million individuals in the United States. The morbidity of CHF includes recurrent hospitalizations, which also drive up health care costs. New therapies for CHF have improved outcomes, but mortality remains high. Because perioperative risk for revascularization is higher in patients who have reduced systolic dysfunction and the benefit may not always be certain; noninvasive risk stratification for patients who have viable myocardium becomes essential. Detection of myocardial viability in patients who have coronary artery disease (CAD) and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction (with either MPI or FDG imaging) is generally regarded as a class I recommendation (level B evidence). LV dysfunction in ischemic heart disease may be due to prior infarct and scar or viable tissue that can be stunned, hibernating, or normal remodeled myocardium. Approximately 70% of CHF is secondary to CAD and a significant number of these patients have myocardial hibernation.
