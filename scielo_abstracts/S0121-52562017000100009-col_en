The intraventricular meningioma (IVM) account for 0.5-5% of all meningiomas, of which approximately 80% are located in the trigone of the lateral ventricle. They originate in the ventricles of content arachnoid cap cells in the choroid plexus are the group common intracranial tumor in adults. In most cases, tumors are histologically benign, slow-growing. Primary intraventricular meningiomas account for between 0.5 and 3% of intracranial meningiomas. They are uncommon in the pediatric population and comprising less than 3% of pediatric brain tumors and only 1.5 to 1.8% of all intracranial neoplasms. Pediatric tumors also show an association with neurofibromatosis type 2 and previous exposure to radiation. We present two contrasting cases of intraventricular meningioma in pediatric and adult patients. Age and site of injury in pediatric patients is rare. The excision of the lesion and prompt treatment allowed the cessation of symptoms in 2 patients.
