Progeria: coronary artery disease and heart failure in a young patient Progeria is a disease characterized by premature aging in the first years of life. The diagnosis is essentially clinical and survival beyond adolescence is unusual. In over 80% of cases death due to cardiovascular complications. The case report of a male patient of 26 years old, diagnosed with progeria, coursing hospitalization for acute inferio-latero-dorsal myocardial infarction with electric and hemodynamic right ventricular involvement is presented. In summary, patients with progeria usually appear with coronary disease at early ages. The records of these groups of patients report that the vast majority die during adolescence due to coronary disease. We report a case of a young patient with severe coronary artery disease who presents with an acute myocardial infarction with favorable resolution.
