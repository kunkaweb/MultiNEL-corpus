Abstract: Paracoccidioidomycosis is a deep systemic mycosis, endemic in some Latin American countries, however in Uruguay it is rare and is closely linked to patient occupation. The clinical case of a 26-year-old man, immunocompetent, who presented clinically with lymphadenopathy, mucous skin lesions and respiratory symptoms of subacute evolution is described; As radiological findings, it presented bilateral perihilar infiltrates and inverted halo image. From the mycological point of view, the presence of the microorganism in several biological samples was evidenced: biopsies of oropharyngeal lesions and mycological study of skin lesions, with positive serology for Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Targeted treatment with intravenous antifungal was performed presenting good response to it with clinical improvement. The patient was approached by a multidisciplinary team made up of Otolaryngology, Parasitology and Mycology, Pathology, Infectology, Occupational Health and Internal Medicine.
