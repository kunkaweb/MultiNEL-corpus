Summary Tuberculosis is a pathology that has evidenced a significant global increase in the last years. Severe sepsis and septic shock may be caused by any micro-organism. However, some of them, such as the Micobacterium tuberculosum complex, only result in these clinical symptoms exceptionally, and thus diagnosis constitutes a challenge for the health team. The study presents the case of a 23 year old immunocompetent female patient who was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit at 28 week of gestation due to a respiratory failure. The patient was diagnosed with bacteremia and septic shock caused by Micobacterium tuberculosis and mother-to-child transmission was confirmed. The patient died 48 hours after admission with hypoxemia and refractory shock.
