Aneurysms of the coronary arteries are very rare. Occur more frequently in the right coronary artery, followed by those of the left anterior descending coronary artery and circumflex. Aneurysms of the left main coronary artery are even more rare. The disease most often associated with this pathology is coronary atherosclerosis with severe stenosis in the section adjacent to them. Tertiary syphilis with cardiovascular manifestations can produce aortitis, aortic insufficiency, myocarditis and aneurysms or coronary stenosis. The gold standard for diagnosis of coronary aneurysms is coronary angiography and treatment depends on the etiology and location thereof. Antibiotic treatment in tertiary syphilis is imperative; however there is no consensus on the treatment of coronary aneurysms in the absence of obstructions. The long-term treatment with oral anticoagulants may be recommended in these patients.
