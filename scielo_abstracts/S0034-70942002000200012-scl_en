BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary embolism is a common postoperative complication. This report aimed at presenting a case of pulmonary embolism in the operating room and at calling the attention to the importance of venous thrombosis prophylaxis in surgical patients. CASE REPORT: The authors describe a case of a male patient, 55 years of age and 83 kg submitted to radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. At the end of the surgery and already extubated, patient presented hemodynamic instability and a decrease in SpO2 to 80%. Patient was re-intubated and sent to the ICU. CT images suggested pulmonary embolism. Patient died in the 5th postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS: A high suspicion rate is not enough to establish a diagnosis because pulmonary embolism is a silent disease and its investigation routine is not highly sensitive. Early prophylaxis is the best strategy.
