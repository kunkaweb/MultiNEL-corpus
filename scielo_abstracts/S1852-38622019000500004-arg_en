Takobsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) and congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) are two entities that present a delay of cardiac repolarization and their association has been published in case reports. We present the case of a 55-year-old female patient with medical history of congenital LQTS, who was admitted to our hospital due to precordial pain after a stressful event and TC was diagnosed. She evolves with QT interval prolongation on the ECG that remains after the externalization, without presenting any episodes of ventricular arrhythmia or syncope.
