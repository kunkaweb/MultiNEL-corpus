The objective was to describe the analytic-hermeneutic movement applied in investigations with the child who had Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome by vertical transmission, and who is in transition from childhood to adolescence, sustained in the Heideggerian theoreticalphilosophical and methodological framework. The modes of conducting the stage of analysis are described, since the research question related to the interpretative analysis of meanings, culminating in the proposition of the assistance possibilities in caring for the study population. This framework proved to be coherent with the principles of humanistic nursing and with its object of study, and contributed to the approximation between theory and practice of care, by means of the comprehension of the phenomena that permeate the lived experience of health of individuals, families and society.
