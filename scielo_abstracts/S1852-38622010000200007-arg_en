We present a case of a 36 years-old female patient who presents palpitations and dyspnea, with heart failure due to non-compacted cardiomyopathy and severe left ventricular systolic deterioration. Due to the absence of improvement instead of full medical tolerated treatment, we decided to install cardiac resynchronization therapy device with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator device. One year after placement of the device, the patient is asymptomatic with clear improvement of echocardiographic parameters.
