ABSTRACT  Objective: Hemangioblastoma is a rare vascular sporadically occurring CNS tumor that can be associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Hemangioblastomas account for 2-6% of all spinal cord neoplasms and rank third among intramedullary space-occupying lesions.   Methods: This was the first time in our practice that we had dealt with paravertebral hemangioblastoma with the sandglass growth pattern. The world literature describes only 3 case of a tumor with this growth pattern. Surgical and diagnostic aspects of patient treatment are considered.   Results: During the operation, we adhered to the following stages: localization of the feeding vessel and of the poles of the tumor, surface dissection of the tumor, en bloc resection of the tumor, and hemostasis of the tumor cavity.   Conclusions: Hemangioblastoma of extradural localization is a very rare pathology. However, when MRI signs characteristic of a vascular lesion are identified, it is necessary to carry out additional examinations, which may include CT perfusion study and, if required, selective angiography.
