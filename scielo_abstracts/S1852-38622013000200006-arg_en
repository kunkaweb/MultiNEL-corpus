Tachycardiomyopathy (TCM) constitutes a potentially reversible cause of cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock. Clinical outcome is favorable in those cases without dilatation and thinning of the ventricular walls if diagnosis is made promptly. Treatment is based on hemodynamic support, heart rate control and conversion to sinus rhythm (SR) where possible. We report a 44 year-old male who presented with acute onset tachyarrhythmia, left ventricular dysfunction, symptoms of congestive heart failure and sustained hypotension. Intravenous infusion of beta blockers in the setting of refractory cardiogenic shock due to TCM proved to be useful for successfully controlling and suppressing the tachycardia.
