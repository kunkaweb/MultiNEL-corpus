BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pain and anxiety may cause major discomfort, increase the risk for postoperative complications in surgical patients and may even prolong their hospital stay. This study aimed at reviewing concepts of sedation and analgesia in intensive care, updating knowledge and reviewing information available in the literature as well as already published consensus. CONTENTS: Sedation and analgesia are presented in separate, reviewing each group of available drugs, their major characteristics and side-effects. We have included some protocols used in our ICU for analgesia and sedation as well as the conclusions of the latest consensus of the American College of Critical Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the therapeutic armamentarium available, there is a lack of understanding about major characteristics of drugs used for sedation and analgesia in Intensive Care. Developed consensus try to explain qualities and side-effects of most popular drugs, normalizing their use for ICU analgesia and sedation to benefit and faster recover patients.
