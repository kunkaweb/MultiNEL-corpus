Abstract: The relationship between thrombosis and c√°ncer is widely knkown. However, this relationship is often underestimated in hematologic neoplasms, what needs to be borne in mind my clinicians. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) may constitute the initial manifestation of acute leukemia or precede its diagnosis. The meticulous search for splenomegaly and lymphadenopathies in the clinical examination, as well as the careful analysis of complete blood count are crucial for diagnostic purposes, and has direct prognostic and therapeutic implications. The study presents the clinical case of a patient with deep vein thrombosis in the left lower limb as a debut of acute leukemia.
