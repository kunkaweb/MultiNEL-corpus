ABSTRACT Peripheral ossifying fibroma (POF) is a benign lesion, nodular, firm on palpation; the base is sessile or pedunculated; similar in color to the mucosa and epithelium; it may be preserved or ulcerated. It is prevalent in female and exclusively affects the gingiva. It is usually associated with irritating factors such as caries, dental plaque, among others. The objective of the present study is to report the case of a 27-years-old female patient, presenting a lesion in the mandible, complaining of an increased volume. Surgical excision was the treatment of choice. The patient is 24 months postoperatively with no signs of relapse.
