Abstract Haemophilic pseudotumor is a rare complication in haemophiliacs and it consists of an encapsulated hematoma that gradually grows in size. The study presents the clinical case of a 17 year old patient who had a pseudotumor of the thigh, which was completely resected through surgical treatment. The pathogenesis, paraclinical studies and current treatment of the haemophilic pseudotumor are discussed. The study emphasizes on the importance of early diagnosis which allows for a planned and timely treatment that results in a reduction of the morbi-mortlity of this unusual, though important, complication of haemophilia.
