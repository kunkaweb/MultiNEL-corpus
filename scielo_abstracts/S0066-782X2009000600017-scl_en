Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is a rare cardiac disorder. It is more frequently a congenital, but it may also be an acquired condition. Takayasu's disease is an extremely rare cause of this disorder. Most cases of unruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm are asymptomatic. Compression of the left coronary artery is an unusual manifestation of the disease that can cause angina, myocardial infarction or death.
