Placenta accreta is one of the most common placental abnormalities that can even lead to maternal and fetal death and can be prevented with opportune diagnosis. Objective: To describe the MRI findings in patients with suspected placental adherence and correlate the results with surgery. Materials and Methods: We present a series of case study in patients with suspected placental invasion to evaluate the findings of MRI compared to the results of the surgery, which was used as the reference standard. Results: There were two cases of placenta accreta, in which MRI shows previous venous lakes were identified in the first case and venous lakes in the segment for the second case, both thinning and discontinuity of the hypointense line corresponding to the myometrium. Conclusion: MRI becomes a useful diagnostic tool for establishing the presence, degree of infiltration and penetration of the placental abnormality or conversely the absence of this condition.
