The objective of the present case report was to describe the aesthetic and functional rehabilitation of the upper anterior incisors of a patient with bruxism. A 23-year-old male patient, with bruxism, sought treatment for his upper anterior teeth due to diastemas and reduced lengths of the upper central incisors. The gingivoplasty and osteotomy were performed in the region of the upper central incisors to improve the positions of the gingival contours and increase the length of these teeth. After 90 days, teeth whitening was performed. After 1 month the composite resin veneers were made in the upper central incisors. During treatment, the needs and perspectives of the patient were considered to achieve clinical success. The treatments were finalized, and the final result was satisfactory. Therefore, an integrated treatment plan proved to be extremely important, especially when the patient is adequately informed of the available treatment options and collaborates with the treatment.
