The posterior fossa decompression is a form of treatment suggested for patients with basilar invagination (BI) secondary to hypoplasia symptomatic of the clivus and atlantoaxial alignment preserved. Based on the fact that the worsening of cranial-cervical kyphosis (decrease of clivus-canal angle to less than 150o) can result in anterior brainstem compression, we propose that some patients may benefit from the cranio-cervical fixation. We present a case report of a patient with BI secondary to clivus hypoplasia who underwent cranio-cervical fixation in extension, with a reduction in clivus-canal angle and improvement of symptoms without posterior fossa decompression.
