ABSTRACT  Objective: report the experience of applying the theoretical data saturation technique in qualitative research with schoolchildren.  Method: critical reading of primary sources and compilation of raw data, followed by thematic grouping through colorimetric codification and allocation of themes/types of statements in charts to find theoretical saturation for each grouping.  Results: colorimetric codification occurred according to previously established themes: bodily hydration; physical activities and play; handling of sickle-cell disease; feeding and clothing. On the eleventh interview, it was possible to reach the theoretical saturation of themes, with four additional interviews being performed.  Conclusion: this experience report enabled the description of the five sequential steps for identification of theoretical data saturation in qualitative research conducted with schoolchildren.
