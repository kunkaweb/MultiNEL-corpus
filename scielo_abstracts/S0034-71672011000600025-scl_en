The Nursing education is still strongly related to the biomedical model, although there were efforts to structure a Nursing perspective in this context. This paper aims to describe an experience of teaching, which used the case study to discuss Nursing process, care and use of standardized language. This experience was developed with 35 students at the fifth semester of nursing undergraduate at a public university in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. This teaching strategy had limitations and challenges related to students' participation, but it was more interesting for them when compared to lectures because it have made them feel like subjects in the teaching-learning process and co-responsible for own formation.
