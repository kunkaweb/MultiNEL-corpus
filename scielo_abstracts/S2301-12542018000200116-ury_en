Abstract: Illicit consumption of anabolic-androgenic steroids for aesthetic purposes has increased in recent years. Hepatocellular damage is more frequent, but cholestasis is more dangerous and may be associated with renal failure. The clinical records of two young men, amateur athletes who consulted for jaundice in the last year and denied its consumption at the beginning, are described. Except for the drug interruption, hepatotoxicity by anabolics has no specific treatment. Usually presented as cholestatic liver disease and renal failure, case reports are fundamental to characterize its clinical-evolutionary presentation. This may also allow clinicians to firmly consider diagnosis even when the patient denies consumption.
