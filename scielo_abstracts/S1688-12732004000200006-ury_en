The incidence of neurological complications after a regional blockade is low, but the effects could be devastating because of permanent and severe lesions. The knowledge of the possible causes of this complications is very important in order to avoid them. The peripherical nerve lesions could appear during the perioperative process and are frequently objects of claims, one of the most frequently affected is the brachial plexus. We presented a case of postoperative neuropraxia after a brachial plexus blockade by interescalenic access for an orthopedic surgery of the superior extremity, showing how many factors could be involved in this bad outcome. Trying to minimize the incidence of this complication, we analyze the probable causes of the accident, ending it with the general recommendations and considerations which allows us to make a successful peripherical blockade with the optimal safety conditions.
