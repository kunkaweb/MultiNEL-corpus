Venous thromboembolism is a relatively frequent condition with a high morbidity and mortality rate. The risk in pregnant patients is five times greater than in not pregnant ones. It's the second cause of death amongst them. Prevention, diagnosis and therapeutic management are complicated by scarcity of approaches and validated evidence. We report the case of a pregnant 9.2 weeks of pregnancy diagnosed with venous thromboembolism evolving with hemodynamic compromise and the need for use of thrombolytics.
