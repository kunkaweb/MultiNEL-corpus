The reconstruction of the craniofacial complex has been an important challenge in the field of reconstructive surgery and for years there has been a diversity of materials used. The results, as with other bony craniofacial reconstructions, depend on the surgical abilities, the quality of the adjacent soft tissues, the size and localization of the osseous defect and the selected reconstructive method. We present the case of a soldier who suffered a firearm wound and who had a craniofacial reconstruction using polyether-ether -ketones (PEEK), a material available for medical use since 1998.
