Cardiac arrest in athletes has a high impact in family and society, fortunately its incidence is low. In athletes younger than 35 years old the most frequent causes are genetic anomalies and cardiomyopathies. We report the case of a 17 years old male patient who presented cardiac arrest and reanimation while doing physical activity. The post-reanimation electrocardiogram showed a subepicardial injury in the anterior face, detecting in cinecoronariography as only finding the presence of myocardial bridging in the middle third of anterior descending artery.
