Double lip is a rare anomaly characterized by a redundancy of labial mucosa visible during mouth opening or during smiling. It occurs more frequently in the upper lip. The treatment is surgical and there are many techniques for its correction. In our clinical case we used an elliptical excision of mucosal and submucosal tissue combined with a vertical midline z-plasty of the upper lip. Satisfactory aesthetic result was achived.
