SUMMARY  Background:  Acute tuberculous appendicitis is a rare disease. It constitutes from 0.001 % to 0.01 % of the clinical forms of tuberculosis. We present cases of such disease as probably cause for surgical acute abdomen.  Case report:  Male aged 29 with mild to moderate diffuse abdominal pain, which intensified and localized in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, fever, vomiting, malaise, leukocytosis (11,300/ÂµL) and 91 % neutrophils. Appendectomy was performed, the histopathological report was acute appendicitis, Ziehl-Neelsen stain was positive. Three days later he returned home and had no short- or long term complications.  Conclusion:  Acute tuberculous appendicitis is a rare disease that may cause acute abdomen, patients should receive drug treatment to eradicate the cause and have proper epidemiological monitoring.
