Abstract: Urachal carcinoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of male predominance between the fifth to sixth decade of life. It is typically located in the dome of the bladder, with a predominant histopathological pattern of adenocarcinoma in 90% of cases. It has an indolent course with clinical manifestations in late stages characterized by hematuria, abdominal pain, dysuria, mucosuria, among others. Diagnosis is based on the finding of the lesion by endoscopic and imaging techniques. Given the infrequent nature of this pathology, we describe the case of a female patient in her fourth decade of life with recurrent urinary tract infection, who was documented by MSCTU of bladder polyp resected by TURP with a histological report of enteric-type adenocarcinoma.
