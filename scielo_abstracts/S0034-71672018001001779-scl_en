ABSTRACT  Objective: to report the application of a participatory teaching-learning method on the themes death, dying, and associate care to highlight its applicability to the students.  Method: report of application of participatory method in 22 students from the 6th period of the undergraduate program in Nursing and Obstetrics of a public university. The first stage focused on personal experiences of the students and the second on professional prospects. As resources for data collection we used music, drawing, drama, and photography.  Results: after applying the method, the students assigned meanings to death and nursing care, reflected, criticized, and resignified experiences on the theme.  Conclusion: the method was considered applicable and effective to achieve the objective, that is, it enables learners to act as protagonists of the teaching-learning process, building together a new perspective of end-of-life care.
