To promote, protect and support the breastfeeding, the health professional needs to acquire and to incorporate, beyond the knowledge in breastfeeding and clinical competences, abilities of communication to interact with the wet-nurse. To describe an educative proposal for the handling and the incentive for the act of the breastfeeding to the professionals of the team of Licensed Practical Nurse of a maternity hospital in the inland of SÃ£o Paulo state - Brazil. The methodology that was used consisted of expositive dialogued classes, group dynamics, dramatization and debates with the objective to stimulate a critical and wide look, embracing social, cultural, economical aspects that involve breastfeeding and that provide the professional a reflection on his own professional practicals. Besides these, we used pre-test, post-test, self-test and clinical lecture. The satisfactory results in as much as in the pre, post and self-tests as in the effective participation of the ones involved with the jobs show that an educative proposal that gave privileges to a larger participation and interaction was shown effective to approach complex themes that involve multiple aspects as the maternal breastfeeding. We believe that changes in the practicals of health depend also on the sensitization of this professional to incorporate these knowledges to his professional practicals.
