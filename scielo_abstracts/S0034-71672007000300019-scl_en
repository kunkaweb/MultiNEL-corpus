The study aimed at implementing the nursing process for a post-partum woman with cardiomyopathy after cardiorespiratory arrest. We conducted a clinical case study, in an intensive care unit of Fortaleza, Cear√°, Brazil, in the period from September to October, 2005. The data were obtained after evaluation for elaboration of Nursing Diagnoses according to NANDA Taxonomy II, clinical judgment, intervention and goals. The nursing diagnoses found were: impaired verbal communication, decreased cardiac output, inefficient respiratory pattern, excessive volume of fluids, diarrhea, impaired physical mobility and deficit in selfcare. We highlighted the importance of the process as focus of the nurse's work in the clinic, in order to favor the patient's return to his family context as well as give credibility to the nurse's job.
