Objective: to describe a case of an unusual m端llerian anomaly. Design: case report. Case report: a 34 years old white nulligravida presented with complains of suspected uterine septum observed during a routine ultrasonographic examination. Gynecological examination revealed a longitudinal vaginal septum which arrived in hymeneal region and two uterine cervixes. Three dimensional pelvic ultrasonography showed cervix duplication, uterine septum from isthmus to endometrial cavity and absence of uterine body division, compatible with complete uterine septum and true dual cervices. Conclusion: this case represents a rare malformation that is not included in usual classification of m端llerian malformations and is not explained by the traditional embryologic vision that supports the unidirectional m端llerian fusion. The three-dimensional ultrasonography, a non-invasive and lower cost exam, is a diagnostic option that must be considered in diagnosis arsenal of m端llerian malformations.
