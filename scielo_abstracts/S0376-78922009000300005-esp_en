One of the most inconvenient situations for a woman, mostly if young, is the recurrent vulvo-vaginitis. With the presence of a returning genital herpes infection, with its permanent pain, the sexual life of the couple will be a point of discordance that may lead to an unsustainable intimacy. The authors relate a successful case of a new treatment that consists in a submucosal lamellar fatgrafting, with preservation of the stromal vascular fraction (SFV) rich in Adipose Derived Stromal/Stem Cells (ADSCs) and able to induce a neoangiogenesis, that will promote the normal immunological defense of the mucosa of the vagina, providing against the use of antibiotics and expensive therapies, and, most of all, leading to a normal sexual life. The successful technique used in this case is described in the article.
