Abstract: Methemoglobinemia is a clinical entity caused by oxidation of hemoglobin (Hb) specifically heme, transforming iron from a ferrous state (Fe2+) to a ferric state (Fe3+++), resulting in methemoglobin (MetHb), which is not capable of bonding with oxygen (O2), and therefore cannot transport it, conditioning tissue irrigation. Hb may oxidize due to variable expression genetic abnormalities expression, or more frequently, as an adverse effect related to exogenous substances, such as dapsone. This work describes the clinical picture, diagnosis and treatment of a patient with metahemoglobinemia-acquired secondary to dapsone overdose.
