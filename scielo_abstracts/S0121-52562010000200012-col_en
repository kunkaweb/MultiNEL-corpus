Since the work of Reidel (1898), there have been considerable advances in the management of frontal trauma. However, the treatment for this trauma is still controversial, so if given the case of inappropriate management, it can imply serious complications. In this article seven cases handled by the service of Oral Surgery and Maxilofacial of the Central Military Hospital (HMC) of Bogot√°-Colombia are reported. A literature review was prepared on managing fracture of frontal sinus and the different technologies used, especially in the frontal recess obliteration with available autogenous or alloplastic materials and the most frequent complications.
