Abstract  OBJECTIVE To describe the thermoregulation protocol implementation for newborns (NB).   METHODS An experimental report, conducted at a neonatal unit in Salvador, Bahia, from January 2016 to January 2017. The Plan, Do, Check, Action cycle guided the construction, implementation and applicability of the protocol.
