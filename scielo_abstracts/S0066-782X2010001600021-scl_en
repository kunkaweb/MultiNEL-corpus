We describe the case of a 62-year-old patient who returned for evaluation nine months after receiving an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) with signs of delayed right ventricular (RV) perforation. The clinical signs that allowed the diagnosis of this late presentation to be achieved are discussed herein, as well as the conduct and the frequency of this complication in the literature.
