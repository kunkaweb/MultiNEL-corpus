Abstract Biologic therapies with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?) monoclonal antibodies were a revolution in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The use of antibodies implies a high risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis and thus a thorough assessment is necessary, both upon the initiation of treatment and during patient follow up, to rule out a latent infection or active tuberculosis. The study presents the first clinical case of pulmonary tuberculosis associated with biologic therapy described in Uruguay (adalimumab).
