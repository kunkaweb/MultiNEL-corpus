There are few published studies regarding the use of negative pressure therapy in wounds located in the head and neck regions. This probably occurs because of the anatomical complexity of these areas, which may difficult the use of a sealed dressing. We present the clinical case of a patient with a vast ulcer on the frontal region, extending to the eyebrow and with bone exposure. We decided to stimulate the growth of granulation tissue over bone surface through negative pressure therapy and proceed to an autologous skin graft, with excellent results. The use of adjuvants to the negative pressure dressing allowed us to be safe and efficient in an area of difficult approach. The anticipated knowledge of possible complications made it possible to use prophylactic measures.
