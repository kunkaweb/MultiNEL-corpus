SUMMARY A case of a patient with complex regional syndrome in the right foot with progressive evolution, severe intensity and resistant to treatment is reported. Given the poor response to pharmacological treatment a right lumbar sympathetic block and eventually pulsed radiofrequency in the same act was scheduled. With the radiofrequency needles situated at the first, second and third lumbar vertebral level, lidocaine was administered. Pain relief and increase in foot temperature was noticed. In order to prolong the effect pulsed radiofrequency was performed. Pain control was achieved with a decreased demand for analgesics and physical rehabilitation could be started. The patient was discharged 72 hours after the procedure and six month later is asymptomatic. The interventional pain treatment and the unused performance of sympathetic block and radiofrequency in the same procedure are discussed.
