summary Objective. Evaluation and follow-up of two patients whom Stellate Ganglion Blockade (SGB) Technique was performed to treat chronic refractory angina. Clinical cases. We analyzed during a year period two patients with refractory angina despite optimal medication who underwent repeated Stellate Ganglion Block under fluoroscopic guidance by left anterior approach. We recorded the presence or absence of chest pain and the number of anti-angina medications pre and post-treatment. Both patients achieve pain relief without complications. The period of complete pain relief was two and three months for each patient. SGB was repeated when angina returned. Conclusions. Temporal sympathectomy may provide a safe and effective option in patients with angina pectoris that is refractory to optimal medication and revascularization as part of holistic care. Continuous fluoroscopy monitoring may also prevent serious complications.
