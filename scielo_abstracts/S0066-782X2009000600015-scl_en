The accumulation of chyle in the pericardial space, or chylopericardium, is a condition occurring most frequently after trauma, cardiac and thoracic surgery, or in association with tumors, tuberculosis or lymphangiomatosis. When its precise cause cannot be identified, it is called primary or idiopathic chylopericardium. This is a rare clinical entity. We report the case of a surgically treated 20-year-old female patient. A brief review of the literature and comments on the clinical presentation, etiopathogenesis, ancillary diagnostic tests and treatment options are also presented.
