ABSTRACT We report the case of a 25-year-old female patient having a large lesion in the right breast. The core biopsy revealed a high-grade fusocellular neoplasm. Immunostains show no evidence of a specific line of differentiation. The patient underwent radical surgery and adjuvant treatment. Due to the immunohistochemical profile and the rosette arrangement in fusocellular injury, a molecular evaluation of translocations associated to the Ewing sarcoma (ES) was made. However, translocations commonly associated with this disease [t(11;22)(q24;q12)] were not observed. The present report can contribute to the diagnostic investigation of similar cases and to the pre-test orientation of the molecular evaluation.
