Abstract: Duodenal atresia is a rare cause of intestinal occlusion. Generally, the diagnosis is made in the prenatal stage or in the neonatal period mainly for those cases of complete occlusion, whereas those with incomplete occlusion may be diagnosed later. We present the case of a patient with an uncommon presentation, with diagnosis after one year of life. A duodenum-duodenum anastomosis was performed, with good postoperative evolution.
