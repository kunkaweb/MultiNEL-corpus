Pyogenic granuloma (PG) is a non-neoplastic proliferative lesion. This term, however, is a misconception, since it is not related to any infection, does not contain pus and it is not a true granuloma. The occurrence of recurrent PG associated with vascular lesions on the skin, such as port-wine stains, has been described in the literature. A 23 years old male patient was attended in the Federal University of Maranh√£o presenting a lesion with pyogenic granuloma characteristics in the buccal side of the first molar associated with port-wine stain. The diagnosis was confirmed per an excisional biopsy, along with histopathologic analysis. Due to the recurrence of the lesion after the surgical approach, intralesional corticosteroid injections was performed three times. After two-years no signs of recurrence could be observed. In conclusion, despite of the high prevalence of Pyogenic Granuloma recurrence, intralesional corticosteroid injections may be an alternative option to conventional surgical treatment.
