Abstract: Treatment of colorectal hepatic metastases has gradually changed in the last 20 years. Nowadays, surgical treatment remains one of the major curative treatment options available to patients. Survival in patients who may undergo a surgical resection of the tumor may add up to 40% in 5 yearsâ€™ time. These promising oncologic results have led surgical teams to make their best to achieve extreme liver resections which used to be contraindicated in the past. Thus, within this line of work, the liver remodeling surgery developed, which surgery consists in altering the portal flow aiming for a liver hypertrophy in the healthy liver and a liver atrophy of the sick liver. The following study aims to present one of the most frequent remodeling surgeries in the world: the two staged hepatectomy with portal flow occlusion. Indication, surgery opportunities, oncologic benefit and viability in our country are also discussed in the study.
