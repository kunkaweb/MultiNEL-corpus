In premature the neonatal respiratory difficulty syndrome is a common entity, but less frequent in the newborn that has reached pulmonary maturity. An exceptional cause of neonatal respiratory difficulty syndrome, is a diaphragm eventration. It could be caused by a phrenic nerve injury, or diaphragm congenital muscular deficiency.We present a clinic case in one newborn with neonatal respiratory difficulty syndrome, whose evolution was favorable. We took different types of image studies which made evident a diaphragm eventration, that later remained free from symptoms without trearment surgical. We wanted to emphasize differential diagnoses among: congenital diaphragmatic herniation, phrenic nerve injury, diaphragm congenital muscular deficiency and there are controversies related to the indication of diaphragmatic plication in asyntomatic patients.
