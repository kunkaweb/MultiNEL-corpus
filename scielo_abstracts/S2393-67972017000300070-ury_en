Abstract:Carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCFs) are vascular shunts that allow blood to flow from the carotid artery into the cavernous sinus; they can produce symptoms in both sexes at any age. Some fistulas are characterized by a directconnection between the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus, other CCFs are dural, consisting of a communicationbetween the cavernous sinus and 1 or more meningeal branches of the internal carotid artery, the external carotid artery, or both. Endovascular management is the treatment modality of choice in these cases.We report the use of n-butilcianoacrilate (NBCA) in the successful transarterial embolization of a dural CCF fed by arterial branches of the internal but principally external carotid arteries (Barrow type D)in a 1 year old child.
