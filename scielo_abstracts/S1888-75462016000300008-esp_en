We report a carrier of the KCNH2 gene for the long QT syndrome. He was diagnosed after the sudden death of a relative. The long QT syndrome (and other canalopathies) genetic study is being a new weapon for the prevention of sudden death. In last years, clinical guidelines for the management of genetic carriers without phenotypic manifestations are being published.
