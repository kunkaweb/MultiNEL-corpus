Abstract: Peduncular hallucinosis is a clinical condition characterized by vivid, colorful, complex visual hallucinations that often recur in time and are described in association with midbrain and thalamic lesions. It is a rare phenomenon and its precise pathophysiology is unknown. We describe the case of a 38-year-old woman who developed peduncular hallucinosis in relation to extrinsic compression of the midbrain secondary to a vestibular schwannoma. Clinical features and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed.
