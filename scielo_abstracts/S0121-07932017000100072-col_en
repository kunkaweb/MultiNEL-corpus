SUMMARY Sarcoidosis is characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas that may affect any organ. Heart involvement manifests as cardiomyopathy. Frequency of cardiac involvement in sarcoidosis is around 30 %, but only 5 % of such cases are symptomatic. We report the case of a patient with systemic sarcoidosis diagnosed by means of biopsy of a mediastinal lymph node. Initial treatment was with steroids. She later had cardiac involvement manifested by heart failure and pulmonary edema. Diagnosis was established by echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance. Response to treatment with steroids and cyclophosphamide was favorable.
