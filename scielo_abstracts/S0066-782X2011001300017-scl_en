Coronary artery fistulas are rare and are most often diagnosed by echocardiography or by cine-angiocardiography. However, the computed tomography angiography (CTA) of coronary arteries has been gaining ground. The incidence of this disease is very low, with a more frequent occurrence of fistulas originating in the right coronary artery. There is a higher incidence of coronary artery fistulas to right heart chambers, with coronary artery fistulas to the left ventricle (LV) being rare. Treatment can be surgical or percutaneous. This report describes a case of coronary fistula to left ventricle diagnosed by CT angiography of coronary arteries in a hypertensive and asymptomatic 46-year-old male, who was tested positive for ischemia in an exercise test. The CT angiography ruled out coronary obstructive disease, but it revealed a coronary fistula to the left ventricular cavity.
