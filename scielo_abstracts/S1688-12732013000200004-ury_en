We report the anesthetic management for a cesarean section of a 42 year old patient in the third trimester of pregnancy who had a critical dysfunction of her mechanical aortic valve. We analyze the anesthetic technique and compare general versus regional in the context of a patient who received fibrinolytics and anticoagulant drugs. The hemodynamic monitorization was also revised and described, specially the use of transthoracic echocardiography. We describe the technique used to maintain hemodynamic stability. Conclusions: the management of patients with severe valve disease for a cesarean is an anesthetic challenge. We emphasize the creation of a multidisciplinary team with anesthesiologists, cardiologists and obstetricians. We use a technique to maintain hemodynamic stability and minimize the impact on the product.
