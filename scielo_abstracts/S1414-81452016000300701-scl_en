ABSTRACT  Introduction: This article presents an experience report on the use of bricolage (or DIY - do it yourself) in an educational nursing research.   Objective: To report the experience of the use of bricolage.   Methods: Firstly, a bibliographical survey on the term and its use in scientific circles was made; then the authors present the experience of the application of the method in a master's nursing research. Bricolage has made possible the combination of strategies for building data such as participant observation, semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and the recording of audio tutorial sessions. Data analysis was a peculiar and creative stage in which the authors, supported by bricolage, created their own analysis process.   Conclusions: Among the main results, it can be highlighted the advantages offered by the use of bricolage, as the capture of multi-logical aspects of the phenomena and challenges. Implications for practice: This report contributes to the new methodological options for nursing studies.
