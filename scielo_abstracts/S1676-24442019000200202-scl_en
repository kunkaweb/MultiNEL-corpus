ABSTRACT This article reports the case of a patient with lingual bronchogenic cyst and presents a brief review of discrepancies in the nomenclature of lingual cysts. A 2-year-old male patient was admitted to the pediatric surgery outpatient clinic of a university hospital due to the presence of a 2 cm mass on the dorsal surface of the tongue. The tumor was excised and the anatomopathological report revealed a foregut cyst, bronchogenic subtype. Lingual cysts are rare, especially when compatible with bronchogenic formations. Their pathogenic process is not clear; one of the possibilities is the separation of cells from the primitive gut, before the separation between the esophagus and the trachea. The treatment usually consists of surgical excision.
