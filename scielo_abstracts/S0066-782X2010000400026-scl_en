The assessment of chest pain is a routine in emergency health services. Although this is a common complaint with a broad differential diagnosis. the major concern is the possibility of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Electrocardiography and cardiac enzyme levels are important tools in the investigation of these patients; however. negative results may actually be overlooking the identification of some conditions. We report the case of a female patient with angina. whose baseline tests in the emergency room were negative for changes suggestive of ischemic heart disease. The Wellens syndrome. a recently described disease. is a variant of unstable angina which. if not identified. may result in significant morbidity and mortality.
